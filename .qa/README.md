# QA Directory

This directory contains QA-to-Red test specifications and quality assurance artifacts for the R_Roster application.

## Purpose

According to the **Maturion Build Philosophy** and **Zero Test Debt Constitutional Rule**:

- QA tests must be compiled to RED before implementation begins
- 100% test pass rate is mandatory (100% = PASS, <100% = FAILURE)
- Zero test debt: no skipped, commented, or incomplete tests
- QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green workflow is constitutional

## Structure

QA artifacts for this repository should be organized here following the FPC layerdown guide and QA Catalog Alignment Gate requirements.
