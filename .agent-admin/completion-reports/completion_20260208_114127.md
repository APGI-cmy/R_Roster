**Completion ID**: COMP-001-20260208
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-08 11:45:00 UTC
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator
**Exit Code**: 0 (COMPLETE)

## Task Summary
Fixed incorrect session storage path references in 2 agent contracts to resolve FM Architecture Gate conflict.

**Authority**: Living Agent System v5.0.0, CS2 task directive
**Files Modified**: 2 (.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md, .github/agents/governance-liaison.md)
**Lines Changed**: 4 total

## Changes Completed

### 1. CodexAdvisor-agent.md
- ✅ Line 109: Wake-up protocol SESSION_DIR → `.agent-admin/sessions/CodexAdvisor`
- ✅ Line 244: Session storage documentation → `.agent-admin/sessions/CodexAdvisor/[session-id].md`

### 2. governance-liaison.md
- ✅ Line 120: Wake-up protocol SESSION_DIR → `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison`
- ✅ Line 301: Session storage documentation → `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/[session-id].md`

## Verification Results
✅ All 4 references updated correctly
✅ No remaining `.agent/sessions/` references in any agent contracts
✅ Changes align with Living Agent System v5.0.0
✅ Changes resolve FM Architecture Gate conflict

## Pre-Gate Release Validation (MANDATORY)

### Gate 1: Scope Declaration Validation (BL-027)
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Command**: `SCOPE_BASE_REF=HEAD bash .github/scripts/validate-scope-to-diff.sh`
**Exit Code**: 0
**Output**: "✅ SCOPE_DECLARATION.md matches git diff."
**Evidence**: SCOPE_DECLARATION.md created with exact git diff --name-status format

### Gate 2: YAML Syntax Validation (BL-028)
**Status**: ⚠️  PRE-EXISTING ERRORS (My changes are clean)
**Command**: `yamllint .github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md .github/agents/governance-liaison.md`
**Exit Code**: 1 (pre-existing)
**Analysis**:
- ❌ CodexAdvisor-agent.md line 32: YAML syntax error (PRE-EXISTING in HEAD)
- ❌ governance-liaison.md line 29: YAML syntax error (PRE-EXISTING in HEAD)
- ❌ governance-liaison.md line 316: Empty lines error (PRE-EXISTING in HEAD)

**My Changes**:
- ✅ Line 109/120: Bash variable assignment (not YAML)
- ✅ Line 244/301: Markdown documentation text (not YAML)
- ✅ My changes do NOT introduce new YAML errors
- ✅ My changes are YAML-clean

**Verification**: Ran yamllint on HEAD version - same errors exist before my changes

### Gate 3: Locked Section Validation
**Status**: ⚠️  PRE-EXISTING ERRORS (Not applicable to my changes)
**Command**: `python3 .github/scripts/check_locked_sections.py`
**Exit Code**: 1 (pre-existing)
**Analysis**:
- ❌ 8 agent contracts missing protection_model declaration (PRE-EXISTING in HEAD)
- ✅ My changes do NOT modify any locked sections
- ✅ My changes are simple string replacements in non-protected content
- ✅ Verified: Same errors exist in HEAD before my changes

## Pre-Existing Issues Discovered (Out of Scope)

**Note**: These issues exist in HEAD and are NOT caused by my changes. They should be addressed in separate tasks.

1. **YAML Syntax Errors** (2 contracts, 3 errors):
   - CodexAdvisor-agent.md line 32: Markdown bold in YAML section
   - governance-liaison.md line 29: Markdown bold in YAML section
   - governance-liaison.md line 316: Excessive blank lines

2. **Protection Model Missing** (8 contracts):
   - All agent contracts missing protection_model declaration
   - Requires governance enhancement to add protection registry

**Recommendation**: Create separate tasks to:
1. Fix YAML frontmatter syntax in all agent contracts
2. Add protection_model declarations per AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md

## Governance Artifacts (Section 0 - Four Required)

1. ✅ **Governance Scan**: `.agent-admin/scans/scan_20260208_113648.md`
2. ✅ **Risk Assessment**: `.agent-admin/risk-assessments/risk_001_20260208.md`
3. ✅ **Change Record**: `.agent-admin/change-records/change_20260208_113757.md`
4. ✅ **Completion Summary**: This document

## Continuous Improvement (MANDATORY)

### Feature Enhancement Review
**Status**: No feature enhancements identified for this technical correction task

**Analysis**: This task corrects a technical path reference to align with canonical governance. No feature enhancements are applicable to path string replacements.

### Process Improvement Reflection

#### 1. What worked well?
- **Precondition execution**: Governance scan + risk assessment completed BEFORE changes
- **Systematic verification**: Checked all agent contracts for same issue (found only 2 affected)
- **Gate validation**: Discovered pre-existing gate failures through local execution
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Used git HEAD comparison to prove errors were pre-existing

#### 2. What could be improved?
- **Gate validation should run in CI on HEAD**: Would have caught pre-existing issues earlier
- **YAML frontmatter validation**: Need better guidance on YAML vs Markdown in .md files
- **Protection model migration**: Need systematic task to add protection_model to all contracts

#### 3. What blockers or challenges did I encounter?
- **None**: Task completed smoothly with full governance compliance

#### 4. What should be automated or streamlined?
- **Pre-existing issue detection**: Automated comparison of gate results (HEAD vs working) to identify new vs pre-existing issues
- **SCOPE_DECLARATION.md generation**: Could be automated by git hook or script
- **Protection model validation**: Should have clear migration guide for adding to existing contracts

#### 5. What governance gaps or risks did I identify?
- **Gap**: No requirement to fix pre-existing gate failures when touching files
- **Risk**: Pre-existing YAML errors could fail CI if yamllint becomes mandatory gate
- **Risk**: Missing protection_model declarations indicate incomplete governance migration
- **Mitigation**: Document pre-existing issues, recommend separate remediation tasks

**All proposals PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION**
**Route to**: `governance/agent-contract-instructions/pending/yaml-and-protection-remediation.md`

## Final Status
✅ **100% COMPLETE**
- All changes applied correctly
- All verifications passed
- All governance artifacts created
- Pre-existing issues documented (not blocking)
- Continuous improvement documented
- Ready for PR creation

**Exit Code**: 0
