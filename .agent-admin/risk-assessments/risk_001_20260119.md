**Date**: 2026-01-19T15:04:24Z  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator  
**Repository**: APGI-cmy/R_Roster  
**Change**: Update governance-liaison.md from v2.1.0 to v3.0.0  
**Assessment ID**: RISK-001-20260119

## Risk Categories

### 1. Binding Completeness Risk

**Risk**: Incomplete or incorrect canonical bindings leave governance gaps

**Likelihood**: LOW (using agent-contract-administrator v3.0.0 as reference model)  
**Impact**: CATASTROPHIC (missing BL-027/028 caused 2-day ecosystem failure)  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Mitigation**:
- Use agent-contract-administrator.md v3.0.0 as reference template
- Cross-reference with issue requirements
- Validate all 14 bindings (10 universal + 4 liaison-specific)
- Verify binding paths against governance/canon/ directory

**Success Criteria**: All 14 bindings present, correctly structured, valid paths

---

### 2. Gate Validation Gaps Risk

**Risk**: Gate validation failures during PR handover (BL-027/028)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (historical pattern from PR #44, issue #978)  
**Impact**: HIGH (2-day delay, PR rejection, ecosystem block)  
**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Mitigation**:
- Execute ALL gates locally BEFORE handover
- Create SCOPE_DECLARATION.md (BL-027)
- Run yamllint with exit code 0 requirement (BL-028)
- Run validate-scope-to-diff.sh with exit code 0
- Document ALL gate executions in PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- NO "manual verification" - execute actual scripts
- Guaranteed success, not hope

**Success Criteria**: 
- All gates pass (exit code 0)
- SCOPE_DECLARATION.md present and validated
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF documents all gate executions

---

### 3. Contract Breaking Changes Risk

**Risk**: v3.0.0 changes break existing governance-liaison behavior

**Likelihood**: LOW (additive changes, not destructive)  
**Impact**: HIGH (governance enforcement disruption)  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Mitigation**:
- Preserve all existing governance enforcement sections
- Add bindings without removing existing references
- Maintain backward compatibility with v2.1.0 behaviors
- Review all sections for unintended side effects
- Keep QIW Channel Enforcement section intact
- Preserve Contract Modification Authority prohibition

**Success Criteria**: 
- All v2.1.0 capabilities preserved
- No weakening of existing requirements
- Enhanced governance, not reduced

---

### 4. Self-Modification Violation Risk

**Risk**: Agent-contract-administrator modifying own contract (governance-liaison is different agent)

**Likelihood**: N/A (not applicable - modifying governance-liaison, not self)  
**Impact**: N/A  
**Risk Level**: N/A

**Mitigation**: Not applicable - this is legitimate cross-agent modification per AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md

**Success Criteria**: N/A

---

### 5. YAML Syntax Errors Risk

**Risk**: YAML frontmatter syntax errors cause yamllint failures (BL-028)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (complex YAML structure with 14 bindings)  
**Impact**: HIGH (yamllint warnings ARE errors per BL-028)  
**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Mitigation**:
- Follow agent-contract-administrator.md YAML structure exactly
- Use proper YAML indentation (2 spaces)
- Validate YAML syntax before final handover
- Run yamllint locally and fix ALL warnings
- BL-028: Warnings are errors, not "stylistic"

**Success Criteria**: 
- yamllint exit code 0
- No warnings, no errors
- Valid YAML frontmatter

---

### 6. Test Debt Accumulation Risk

**Risk**: Update process skips validation, creates test debt

**Likelihood**: LOW (no application code, governance-only change)  
**Impact**: LOW (governance changes don't require code tests)  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Mitigation**:
- This is governance documentation change, not code change
- No application tests required
- Gate validation serves as "test" for governance files
- All gates must pass before handover

**Success Criteria**: All gates pass (gate validation = test coverage for governance)

---

### 7. Ripple Incompleteness Risk

**Risk**: Change affects other files not identified or updated

**Likelihood**: LOW (single-file change, no ripple expected)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (if ripple missed, incomplete update)  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Mitigation**:
- Identify all files affected by this change
- governance-liaison.md is standalone contract
- No expected ripple to other agent contracts
- SCOPE_DECLARATION.md will list all changed files

**Success Criteria**: 
- SCOPE_DECLARATION.md complete
- validate-scope-to-diff.sh passes
- No unexpected file changes

---

### 8. Cross-Repo Work Risk

**Risk**: Agent-contract-administrator attempts cross-repo modifications

**Likelihood**: N/A (working in R_Roster only, per scope)  
**Impact**: N/A  
**Risk Level**: N/A

**Mitigation**: Agent-contract-administrator scope is R_Roster only per contract

**Success Criteria**: All changes in APGI-cmy/R_Roster repository only

---

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Composite Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Highest Risks**:
1. Gate Validation Gaps (HIGH) - Must execute all gates locally
2. YAML Syntax Errors (HIGH) - Must pass yamllint with exit code 0
3. Binding Completeness (MEDIUM) - Must have all 14 bindings

**Risk Mitigation Strategy**:
- Use agent-contract-administrator v3.0.0 as exact reference model
- Execute ALL gates locally BEFORE handover
- Document EVERYTHING in PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- No shortcuts, no hoping gates will pass

**Contingency Plan**:
- If any gate fails: FIX immediately, re-run until exit code 0
- If binding gaps found: Add missing bindings before handover
- If YAML errors: Fix syntax until yamllint passes
- If blocker cannot be resolved: ESCALATE to CS2 with full context
