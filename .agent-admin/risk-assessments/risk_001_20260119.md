**Assessment ID**: risk_001_20260119  
**Date**: 2026-01-19 13:52:47 UTC  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator

## Executive Summary

This risk assessment evaluates the governance remediation task to update all 7 agent contracts with complete universal and agent-specific bindings. While the task is critical for governance compliance, it carries manageable risks with appropriate mitigation strategies.

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM (manageable with documented mitigations)

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Binding Completeness Risk

**Description**: Risk of incomplete or incorrect binding additions, leading to ongoing non-compliance.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Overall**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Risk Factors**:
- Complex binding requirements vary by agent type (liaison, foreman, builders)
- Multiple sources of truth (agent-contract-administrator.md reference, issue requirements, canonical docs)
- Easy to miss a binding or misclassify agent-specific vs universal

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use agent-contract-administrator.md v3.0.0 as reference model for universal bindings
- ✅ Create explicit checklist for each agent type
- ✅ Cross-reference with AGENT_FILE_BINDING_REQUIREMENTS.md
- ✅ Systematic review of each contract after update
- ✅ Document all bindings added in change record

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with checklist and systematic approach)

---

### 2. Gate Validation Failure Risk

**Description**: Risk of gate failures during local validation or CI, delaying completion.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Overall**: MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- BL-027: Scope declaration validation (new requirement)
- BL-028: Yamllint warnings treated as errors (strict enforcement)
- YAML frontmatter syntax in .md files can be fragile
- Multiple gates must all pass (scope-to-diff, yamllint, locked sections)

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Create SCOPE_DECLARATION.md BEFORE any file modifications
- ✅ Run yamllint incrementally after each contract update
- ✅ Use existing contracts as syntax templates
- ✅ Test gates locally BEFORE committing (BL-027 requirement)
- ✅ Document gate execution with actual commands and exit codes
- ✅ Override authorization provided by CS2 if technically correct with PREHANDOVER_PROOF

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with incremental validation and CS2 override authorization)

---

### 3. Version Management Risk

**Description**: Risk of version number conflicts or inappropriate version increments.

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Overall**: LOW-MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- Each agent has different current version
- Major vs minor version increment decision needed
- Version history must be documented accurately

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Document current version for each agent in change record
- ✅ Use consistent versioning strategy: MINOR version bump for all (binding addition = minor change)
- ✅ Update version history section with this governance overhaul
- ✅ Reference Phase 2-3 Governance Binding Audit and BL-027/028 as authority

**Recommended Versioning**:
- governance-liaison: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- ForemanApp-agent: 4.1.0 → 4.2.0
- api-builder: 3.1.0 → 3.2.0
- integration-builder: 3.1.0 → 3.2.0
- qa-builder: 3.1.0 → 3.2.0
- schema-builder: 3.1.0 → 3.2.0
- ui-builder: 3.1.0 → 3.2.0

**Residual Risk**: NEGLIGIBLE (with documented strategy)

---

### 4. Test Debt Accumulation Risk

**Description**: Risk of inadvertently introducing test debt or violations during contract updates.

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH (per constitutional doctrine)  
**Overall**: LOW-MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- Modifying YAML frontmatter could break contract parsing
- Agent files might have tests or validation that we're unaware of
- Zero Test Debt is constitutional - any debt is catastrophic

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ These are documentation-only changes (agent contract files)
- ✅ No code logic changes involved
- ✅ YAML syntax will be validated by yamllint gate
- ✅ Contract structure preserved (only adding bindings sections)
- ✅ If any tests exist for agent contracts, they will be discovered during gate validation

**Residual Risk**: NEGLIGIBLE (documentation-only changes)

---

### 5. Binding Accuracy Risk

**Description**: Risk of referencing incorrect canonical paths or document names.

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Overall**: LOW-MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- Canonical governance files are in external repo (APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance)
- Path references must be accurate
- Document names must match exactly

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use agent-contract-administrator.md v3.0.0 as authoritative reference (already updated)
- ✅ All paths already validated in reference contract
- ✅ Copy binding structure directly from reference model
- ✅ Repository: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance confirmed in scan
- ✅ Path: /governance/canon confirmed for all canonical docs

**Residual Risk**: NEGLIGIBLE (using validated reference)

---

### 6. Agent-Specific Binding Gap Risk

**Description**: Risk of missing agent-specific bindings beyond the 10 universal ones.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Overall**: MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- governance-liaison needs 4 specific bindings (not just 10 universal)
- ForemanApp needs 7 specific bindings (not just 10 universal)
- builders need 3 specific bindings (not just 10 universal)
- Issue description mentions these but doesn't provide full list

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Governance scan documents requirements per agent type
- ✅ Reference BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST for builders
- ✅ Reference agent-contract-administrator.md for liaison/foreman patterns
- ✅ Issue mentions "handover checklist" - will look for this documentation
- ✅ Preserve existing agent-specific bindings and augment

**Agent-Specific Bindings Identified**:

**governance-liaison (4 additional)**:
1. agent-recruitment (AGENT_RECRUITMENT_AND_CONTRACT_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md)
2. governance-ripple (GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md)
3. governance-layerdown (GOVERNANCE_LAYERDOWN_CONTRACT.md)
4. scope-to-diff (SCOPE_TO_DIFF_RULE.md)

**ForemanApp (7 additional)**:
1. agent-contract-management (AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md)
2. agent-recruitment (AGENT_RECRUITMENT_AND_CONTRACT_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md)
3. governance-ripple (GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md)
4. governance-layerdown (GOVERNANCE_LAYERDOWN_CONTRACT.md)
5. scope-to-diff (SCOPE_TO_DIFF_RULE.md)
6. fm-execution-mandate (FM_EXECUTION_MANDATE.md)
7. model-tier-binding (MODEL_TIER_AGENT_CONTRACT_BINDING.md)

**builders (3 additional minimum)**:
1. builder-specific binding references (preserve existing)
2. design-freeze (if not already present)
3. test-removal-governance (if not already present)

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with explicit checklist per agent)

---

### 7. Scope Creep Risk

**Description**: Risk of expanding scope beyond binding updates (e.g., trying to "improve" other aspects).

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: LOW  
**Overall**: NEGLIGIBLE

**Risk Factors**:
- Temptation to "fix" other issues while touching files
- Contract administrator authority is broad
- Efficiency pressures

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Strict adherence to issue requirements: binding updates only
- ✅ Preserve all existing content except bindings section
- ✅ Version number update and history documentation only
- ✅ No other changes unless required for YAML syntax compliance
- ✅ Document any non-binding changes as out-of-scope and justify

**Residual Risk**: NEGLIGIBLE (clear scope definition)

---

### 8. Handover Incompleteness Risk

**Description**: Risk of incomplete handover documentation (PREHANDOVER_PROOF, SCOPE_DECLARATION).

**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH (blocks PR acceptance)  
**Overall**: LOW-MEDIUM

**Risk Factors**:
- BL-027 mandates SCOPE_DECLARATION.md
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF must document gate execution
- Missing either = handover rejection

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Create SCOPE_DECLARATION.md as first step (before any file changes)
- ✅ Document gate execution in real-time (not retroactively)
- ✅ Use PREHANDOVER_PROOF template from agent-contract-administrator.md
- ✅ Include all 4 governance artifacts (scan, risk assessment, change record, completion summary)
- ✅ Include pre-gate validation evidence with actual commands and exit codes

**Residual Risk**: NEGLIGIBLE (with systematic documentation approach)
