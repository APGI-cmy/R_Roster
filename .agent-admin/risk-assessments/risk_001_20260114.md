1. Add governance binding to QIW canonical document
2. Add QIW enforcement sections for 5 channels
3. Document QA blocking conditions
4. Document incident memory integration
5. Reference dashboard requirements
6. Update contract versions

**Agents to be Modified** (8):
1. ForemanApp-agent.md
2. governance-liaison.md
3. api-builder.md
4. qa-builder.md
5. ui-builder.md
6. integration-builder.md
7. schema-builder.md
8. CodexAdvisor-agent.md

**Agent Exempted** (1):
- agent-contract-administrator.md (self) - CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION

## Impact Analysis

### High Impact Agents

**ForemanApp-agent**: 
- **Role**: Execution authority, build coordination
- **Impact**: HIGH - Must orchestrate QIW checks across builders
- **Risk**: Medium - Complex coordination logic
- **Mitigation**: Clear QIW execution sequence, delegation model

**governance-liaison**:
- **Role**: Governance enforcement
- **Impact**: HIGH - Must validate QIW compliance in PR gates
- **Risk**: Low - Governance validation is core competency
- **Mitigation**: Clear validation criteria

### Medium Impact Agents

**All Builder Agents** (api, qa, ui, integration, schema):
- **Role**: Code implementation
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Must integrate QIW into build/test workflows
- **Risk**: Low - Well-defined requirements
- **Mitigation**: Uniform implementation across all builders

### Low Impact Agents

**CodexAdvisor-agent**:
- **Role**: Advisory
- **Impact**: LOW - Advisory only, no enforcement
- **Risk**: Negligible
- **Mitigation**: Documentation awareness

---

## Ripple Effects

### Positive Effects
1. ✅ Unified QIW awareness across all agents
2. ✅ Consistent quality enforcement
3. ✅ Clear governance memory integration
4. ✅ Dashboard visibility requirements established
5. ✅ Zero-warning discipline reinforced

### Potential Negative Effects
1. ⚠️ Increased contract complexity (mitigated by clear structure)
2. ⚠️ Requires agents to understand QIW protocol (mitigated by canonical documentation)
3. ⚠️ Coordination overhead for FM (mitigated by clear delegation)

---

## Constitutional Compliance

### Self-Modification Prohibition

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Agent Contract Administrator MUST NOT modify own contract.

**This Assessment**:
- ✅ Task includes 8 agent contracts
- ✅ Excludes agent-contract-administrator.md (self)
- ✅ Compliant with AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md

### Authority Verification

**Question**: Does Agent Contract Administrator have authority to modify other agent contracts?

**Answer**: ✅ YES
- Authority: AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md
- Scope: Governance contract management
- Role: Single-writer for `.agent` files and agent contracts (excluding own)

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Contract syntax errors | LOW | LOW | Validation after modification |
| YAML frontmatter corruption | MEDIUM | LOW | Careful editing, validation |
| Binding conflicts | LOW | LOW | Review existing bindings |
| Version conflicts | LOW | LOW | Increment versions consistently |

### Governance Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Misinterpretation of QIW requirements | MEDIUM | LOW | Reference canonical document directly |
| Incomplete implementation | MEDIUM | LOW | Checklist validation against canonical |
| Self-modification violation | CATASTROPHIC | LOW | Explicit exclusion of own contract |
| Authority overreach | HIGH | LOW | Scope limited to agent contracts only |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Agent confusion about QIW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Clear documentation in each contract |
| Coordination failures | MEDIUM | LOW | FM orchestration guidance |
| Dashboard expectations vs reality | LOW | MEDIUM | Phase-based implementation (per QIW_ALIGNMENT) |

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Uniform Structure
- Apply consistent QIW section structure across all agents
- Use same section headings and organization
- Reference canonical document uniformly

### 2. Clear Role Delineation
- FM: Orchestrate QIW execution
- Governance Liaison: Validate QIW compliance
- Builders: Integrate QIW into workflows
- Advisor: Provide QIW guidance

### 3. Phased Implementation Support
- Acknowledge current state (Phase 1: Governance)
- Clarify future expectations (Phases 2-4: Implementation)
- Align with QIW_ALIGNMENT.md roadmap

### 4. Validation Protocol
- Verify each contract after modification
- Check YAML frontmatter integrity
- Validate markdown structure
- Ensure canonical reference accuracy

---

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 8 agent contracts updated with QIW sections
2. ✅ All contracts reference WATCHDOG_QUALITY_INTEGRITY_CHANNEL.md v1.0.0
3. ✅ All contracts document 5 QIW channels
4. ✅ All contracts document QA blocking conditions
5. ✅ All contracts reference governance memory integration
6. ✅ All contracts reference canonical PR #948
7. ✅ Own contract (agent-contract-administrator.md) NOT modified
8. ✅ Contract versions incremented appropriately
9. ✅ YAML frontmatter intact and valid
10. ✅ Markdown structure preserved

---

## Escalation Triggers

**Immediate Escalation to CS2**:
- Self-modification attempted
- Governance conflict discovered
- Authority unclear
- Constitutional violation detected

**Standard Escalation to FM**:
- Coordination logic unclear
- Builder role ambiguity
- Implementation sequencing questions

---

## Risk Rating

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM

**Justification**:
- Clear canonical requirements
- Well-defined agent roles
- Constitutional compliance verified
- Strong mitigation strategies in place
- Phased implementation reduces urgency

**Recommendation**: ✅ PROCEED with modifications

---

## Post-Implementation Validation

After modifications:
1. Review all 8 modified contracts
2. Verify YAML frontmatter parsing
3. Check canonical reference accuracy
4. Validate version increments
5. Confirm self-contract untouched
6. Test markdown rendering (if tooling available)

---

## Continuous Improvement Note

After completion, assess:
- Were risk predictions accurate?
- Did any unforeseen issues emerge?
- Should risk assessment process improve?
- Document learnings for future tasks

---

**Assessment Result**: ✅ APPROVED TO PROCEED

**Reviewer**: agent-contract-administrator (self-assessment per protocol)  
**Next Step**: Implement QIW sections in 8 agent contracts
