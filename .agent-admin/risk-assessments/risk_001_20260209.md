# Risk Assessment - PR Failure Analysis Protocol Addition
**Date**: 2026-02-09T09:44:11Z  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator  
**Change**: Add PR Failure Analysis Protocol LOCKED section to governance-liaison.md

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Governance Compliance Risk

**Risk**: LOCKED section format non-compliance could invalidate protection  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**:
- Following exact AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md format
- Complete metadata (Lock ID, Reason, Authority, Date, Review frequency)
- Proper authority citation (STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md, CI_CONFIRMATORY_NOT_DIAGNOSTIC.md)
- Pre-gate validation with locked section validation script

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 2. Contract Integrity Risk

**Risk**: Insertion at wrong location could break contract structure  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation**:
- Verified insertion point (line 487, before "Session Outcome Protocol")
- Pure addition (no modification of existing content)
- Proper section separation with horizontal rules
- YAML syntax validation before handover

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 3. Binding Completeness Risk

**Risk**: Missing protocol requirements could create incomplete enforcement  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**:
- Complete protocol provided in task specification
- All 3 mandatory steps included (Read Logs, RCA, Fix Verification)
- Enforcement section with escalation triggers
- Authority citations to canonical governance

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL

---

### 4. Gate Validation Risk

**Risk**: Gate failures during pre-handover validation  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH (blocks handover per BL-027/BL-028)  
**Mitigation**:
- Pre-gate execution before creating PR (MANDATORY)
- Scope declaration validation (BL-027)
- YAML syntax validation (BL-028 - warnings ARE errors)
- Locked section validation
- All gates must show exit code 0

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL (guaranteed success required)

---

### 5. Repeat PR Failure Risk (THE PROBLEM BEING SOLVED)

**Risk**: Without this protocol, blind PR retries continue causing catastrophic failures  
**Likelihood**: HIGH (proven in office-app)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (multi-day ecosystem failures)  
**Mitigation**:
- **THIS CHANGE** adds mandatory PR failure analysis protocol
- Forces root cause analysis before retry
- Requires local verification of fix
- Prevents blind retries

**Residual Risk**: MINIMAL (after this change is deployed)

---

## Special Focus Areas

### Binding Completeness
- ✅ Detection step (check for recent failed PRs)
- ✅ Step 1: Read workflow logs (MANDATORY)
- ✅ Step 2: Root cause analysis (MANDATORY - 3 questions)
- ✅ Step 3: Fix verification (MANDATORY - local testing)
- ✅ Enforcement section (escalation triggers)

### Gate Validation Gaps
- ✅ SCOPE_DECLARATION.md will be created (BL-027)
- ✅ Scope validation script will be executed
- ✅ YAML syntax validation will be executed (BL-028)
- ✅ Locked section validation will be executed
- ✅ All exit codes must be 0 before handover

### Test Debt Accumulation
- N/A (no test code changes)

## Overall Risk Rating

**Before Mitigation**: MEDIUM  
**After Mitigation**: LOW  
**Approval**: PROCEED with change

---

## Risk Monitoring

**During Implementation**:
- Monitor gate execution results
- Verify LOCKED section format compliance
- Validate insertion point accuracy

**Post-Implementation**:
- Verify governance-liaison contract parses correctly
- Monitor first use of PR Failure Analysis Protocol
- Track reduction in repeat PR failures
