---

### 2.2 Governance Risks

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

#### Risk G1: Canonical Drift

**Description**: R_Roster QIW configuration diverges from canonical WATCHDOG_QUALITY_INTEGRITY_CHANNEL.md over time.

**Likelihood**: LOW (governance ripple process exists)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (non-compliance with canonical)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Canonical updates not propagated to R_Roster
- Local modifications to canonical requirements
- Missing governance synchronization

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Layer-down copy explicitly marked as canonical
2. Modification restrictions documented in layer-down notice
3. Governance ripple process will update on canonical changes
4. governance-liaison monitors canonical repository

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 MINIMAL

---

#### Risk G2: Configuration Drift

**Description**: qiw-config.json modified to weaken canonical requirements (e.g., disable blockOnCritical).

**Likelihood**: LOW (constitutional prohibition)  
**Impact**: HIGH (constitutional violation)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Indicators**:
- blockOnCritical set to false
- blockOnError set to false
- Channels disabled without justification
- Detection patterns removed

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Configuration validation enforced in QIW scanner
2. Constitutional requirements (blockOnCritical, blockOnError) cannot be disabled
3. Governance review required for configuration changes
4. Configuration schema validation

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

### 2.3 Implementation Risks

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

#### Risk I1: Implementation Delay

**Description**: QIW scanner implementation delayed indefinitely, QIW never operational.

**Likelihood**: LOW (governance foundation complete)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (QIW benefits not realized)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Application code development delayed
- No Builder assigned to QIW implementation
- QIW implementation deprioritized

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Governance foundation complete (ready for implementation)
2. Implementation scaffold created (clear structure)
3. Execution protocol documented (clear guidance)
4. When application code developed, Builders implement QIW
5. Implementation is incremental (phase-by-phase)

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk I2: Framework Mismatch

**Description**: QIW detection patterns don't match actual build/test framework logs.

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (framework not chosen yet)  
**Impact**: LOW (patterns tunable)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Log formats differ from expected
- Detection patterns produce false positives
- Detection patterns miss real issues (false negatives)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Detection patterns based on common frameworks (Next.js, Jest, ESLint)
2. Configuration allows custom patterns (additive)
3. Whitelist mechanism for false positives
4. Pattern tuning expected during initial operation
5. Test with sample logs during implementation

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk I3: False Positives Block Development

**Description**: QIW detects non-issues as anomalies, blocking legitimate PRs.

**Likelihood**: LOW (patterns based on canonical standards)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (developer frustration, false blocks)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Frequent QA blocks for non-issues
- Developers bypassing QIW
- Whitelist growing excessively

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Whitelist mechanism for approved exceptions
2. Governance approval required for whitelist entries
3. Pattern refinement based on false positives
4. Escalation to human authority for resolution
5. Learning captured for pattern improvement

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk I4: False Negatives Miss Real Issues

**Description**: QIW misses actual quality issues, QA passes incorrectly.

**Likelihood**: LOW (comprehensive detection patterns)  
**Impact**: HIGH (quality issues in production)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Indicators**:
- Quality issues reach production despite QIW pass
- Incidents occur that QIW should have caught
- Detection patterns incomplete

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Comprehensive canonical detection patterns
2. All 5 channels cover different log types
3. Pattern coverage based on industry standards
4. Continuous improvement via governance memory analysis
5. Post-incident pattern updates

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

### 2.4 Operational Risks

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

#### Risk O1: Memory File Corruption

**Description**: qiw-events.json corrupted, governance memory lost.

**Likelihood**: LOW (append-only, atomic operations)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (incident history lost)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Invalid JSON in qiw-events.json
- Missing incidents
- File permission errors

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Append-only write protocol
2. Atomic file operations
3. Schema validation before write
4. File backed up per repository backup policy
5. Incident records immutable

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 MINIMAL

---

#### Risk O2: Dashboard Unavailable

**Description**: Dashboard API down, no QIW visibility.

**Likelihood**: LOW (simple file-based data)  
**Impact**: LOW (QIW still operational, just no visibility)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Dashboard API errors
- Stale dashboard data
- Dashboard not accessible

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. QIW operates independently of dashboard
2. Dashboard reads from file system (high availability)
3. QA blocking works without dashboard
4. Direct memory file access as fallback

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 MINIMAL

---

#### Risk O3: Log File Access Issues

**Description**: QIW cannot read log files, scan fails.

**Likelihood**: LOW (standard file permissions)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (QIW cannot operate)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- File not found errors
- Permission denied errors
- Log path misconfiguration

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Log paths configurable in qiw-config.json
2. Pre-execution validation checks log files exist
3. Clear error messages for missing logs
4. Documentation of log path requirements

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

### 2.5 Security Risks

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

#### Risk S1: Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

**Description**: QIW anomaly context includes sensitive data from logs.

**Likelihood**: LOW (context limited to 3-5 lines)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (data leak)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Passwords in logs
- API keys in logs
- PII in log context

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Anomaly context limited (3-5 lines)
2. Log sanitization recommended (not QIW responsibility)
3. Dashboard access control
4. Memory file permissions (644)
5. No public exposure of incident details

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk S2: Incident Tampering

**Description**: Malicious modification of qiw-events.json to hide incidents.

**Likelihood**: LOW (file permissions, immutability)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (audit trail corruption)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Missing incidents
- Modified timestamps
- Deleted incidents

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Append-only protocol (no deletions)
2. File permissions (644 - read/write owner only)
3. Immutability enforcement
4. Optional cryptographic signatures (future)
5. Git history tracks all changes

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk S3: Dashboard Authentication Bypass

**Description**: Unauthorized access to QIW dashboard revealing project status.

**Likelihood**: LOW (dashboard not implemented yet)  
**Impact**: LOW (informational data only)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Dashboard accessible without auth
- Sensitive data in dashboard responses

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Dashboard authentication required (implementation requirement)
2. Role-based access control
3. Audit logging of dashboard access
4. Dashboard responses do not include sensitive log content

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 MINIMAL

---

### 2.6 Dependencies and External Risks

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

#### Risk D1: Application Code Never Developed

**Description**: R_Roster remains governance-only, no application code.

**Impact**: MEDIUM (QIW never operational)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- No application code after 6 months
- No build system configured
- No test framework established

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Governance foundation complete (no rework needed)
2. QIW configuration ready for when code developed
3. Implementation scaffold provides guidance
4. No governance waste (artifacts useful for learning)

**Residual Risk**: 🟢 LOW

---

#### Risk D2: Build System Choice Incompatible

**Description**: Chosen build system not supported by QIW patterns.

**Likelihood**: LOW (patterns based on common tools)  
**Impact**: LOW (patterns customizable)  
**Overall Risk**: 🟢 LOW

**Indicators**:
- Exotic build system chosen
- Log formats completely different
- Detection patterns don't work

**Mitigation Strategy**:
