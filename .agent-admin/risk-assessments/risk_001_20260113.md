# Risk Assessment: Agent File v2.0.0 Alignment

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13T14:02:25Z  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator  
**Task**: Agent file alignment - v2.0.0 PREHANDOVER_PROOF + mandatory improvement proposals  
**Risk ID**: 001

---

## Repository Context

**Repository**: APGI-cmy/R_Roster (Teacher absenteeism management)  
**Agents Affected**: All 9 R_Roster agents  
**Change Type**: Agent contract enhancement (documentation)

---

## Impact Analysis

### Impact Category 1: Agent Awareness (MEDIUM)
**Description**: All 9 agents will receive enhanced guidance on PREHANDOVER_PROOF requirements  
**Severity**: MEDIUM (improves compliance, no breaking changes)  
**Benefit**: Agents will have clearer understanding of:
- Section 0: Four mandatory governance artifacts
- Section 9: CST validation attestation requirements
- Mandatory improvement proposal expectations
- v2.0.0 template location and usage

### Impact Category 2: Handover Quality (HIGH - POSITIVE)
**Description**: Enhanced handover evidence requirements will improve audit trail  
**Severity**: HIGH POSITIVE (significant governance improvement)  
**Benefit**: 
- Better traceability of governance artifacts
- Explicit CST validation attestation
- Mandatory continuous improvement proposals
- Reduced handover gaps and rework

### Impact Category 3: FM Enforcement (MEDIUM)
**Description**: FM will have clearer criteria for accepting/rejecting handovers  
**Severity**: MEDIUM (enforcement clarity)  
**Benefit**:
- Explicit v2.0.0 requirements in agent contracts
- Clear improvement proposal mandate
- Reduced ambiguity in gate enforcement

### Impact Category 4: Backwards Compatibility (LOW)
**Description**: Existing improvement reflection sections will be enhanced, not replaced  
**Severity**: LOW (additive changes)  
**Note**: Agents already reference PREHANDOVER_PROOF, we're adding v2.0.0 specificity

- Section 0 and Section 9 requirements added
- Improved clarity on existing improvement reflection section

### File/Component 2: Governance Liaison Contract (1 file)
**Expected Ripple Effect**:
- governance-liaison.md
- Enhanced PREHANDOVER_PROOF guidance for governance PRs
- Section 0 and Section 9 requirements added
- Improvement proposal requirement added

### File/Component 3: ForemanApp Agent Contract (1 file)
**Expected Ripple Effect**:

- Enhanced PREHANDOVER_PROOF enforcement criteria
- Section 0 and Section 9 verification requirements
- Improvement proposal enforcement added

### File/Component 4: CodexAdvisor Agent Contract (1 file)
**Expected Ripple Effect**:
- CodexAdvisor-agent.md
- Enhanced PREHANDOVER_PROOF awareness (advisory context)
- v2.0.0 specific guidance for recommendations

### File/Component 5: Agent Contract Administrator (1 file - self)
**Expected Ripple Effect**:
- agent-contract-administrator.md
- Self-monitoring of v2.0.0 compliance
- Enhancement of continuous improvement mandate

### File/Component 6: BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md (optional)
**Expected Ripple Effect**:
- May need update to reflect v2.0.0 as canonical version
- Schema reference alignment

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Inconsistent Implementation Across Agent Files
**Mitigation Approach**: 
- Use consistent section structure across all agents
- Create reusable text blocks for common requirements
- Verify all agents have both Section 0 and Section 9 requirements
- Batch edits to maintain consistency

### Risk 2: Unclear Distinction Between Existing and New Requirements
**Mitigation Approach**:
- Clearly mark v2.0.0 requirements as new/enhanced
- Reference template version explicitly
- Maintain existing improvement reflection sections
- Add v2.0.0 specific subsections where needed

### Risk 3: Over-specification Leading to Agent Confusion
**Mitigation Approach**:
- Keep additions concise and actionable
- Reference template for details (don't duplicate entire template)
- Use bullet points and checklists for clarity
- Link to authoritative sources

### Risk 4: FM Confusion on Enforcement
**Mitigation Approach**:
- Add clear enforcement criteria to ForemanApp-agent.md
- Specify what constitutes v2.0.0 compliance
- Reference Section 0 and Section 9 explicitly
- Maintain improvement proposal tracking guidance

## Residual Risks

**NONE** - All identified risks have mitigation strategies and are LOW severity.

This is a documentation-only change that:
- Adds clarity to existing requirements
- Enhances enforcement of already-established patterns
- Does not break existing functionality
- Aligns with constitutional governance

---

## Constitutional Compliance Risks

**NONE** - This change:
- ✅ Follows AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md
- ✅ Performed by authorized agent (agent-contract-administrator)
- ✅ Does not modify own contract file (.github/agents/agent-contract-administrator.md will be modified by this agent, which IS permitted per contract scope)
- ✅ Aligns with EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md v2.0.0
- ✅ Enforces constitutional principles (continuous improvement, zero debt, 100% handovers)
- ✅ Scoped to R_Roster repository only

**CLARIFICATION**: Per my contract, I CANNOT modify my own contract file to prevent conflicts of interest. However, reviewing the task, if modifications to agent-contract-administrator.md are needed, I must escalate that specific file to CS2 or create an instruction for another agent.

**REVISED APPROACH**: I will modify all 8 other agent files but will create an instruction for modifying agent-contract-administrator.md if needed, OR I will verify my contract scope allows modification of the `.github/agents/agent-contract-administrator.md` file since it's not the `.agent` repository roster file.

**CONTRACT REVIEW**: My contract states:
- "CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION: This agent MUST NOT modify `.github/agents/agent-contract-administrator.md` (this contract file)."
- "CANNOT modify: `.github/agents/agent-contract-administrator.md` (own contract)"

**DECISION**: I will NOT modify agent-contract-administrator.md myself. I will create an instruction for this or escalate. I will modify the other 8 agent files only.

**UPDATED RISK**: Constitutional violation if I modify my own contract  
**MITIGATION**: Exclude agent-contract-administrator.md from direct modifications; create instruction instead

## Conclusion

✅ **Risk Assessment Complete**  
✅ **Impact: NET POSITIVE** (improves governance compliance)  
✅ **Severity: LOW-MEDIUM** (documentation enhancement)  
✅ **Mitigation: COMPREHENSIVE** (all risks addressed)  
✅ **Constitutional Compliance: VERIFIED** (will not modify own contract)  
✅ **Proceed: AUTHORIZED** (with constraint: 8 agent files, create instruction for 9th)

**Next Step**: Change Record (Artifact 3) after implementation
