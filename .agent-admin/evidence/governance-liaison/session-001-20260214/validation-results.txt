========================================

COMPONENT VALIDATION
--------------------

1. Workflow File: .github/workflows/governance-ripple-sync.yml
   ✓ File exists
   ✓ YAML syntax valid
   ✓ Triggers configured:
     - repository_dispatch: governance_ripple
     - workflow_dispatch: manual trigger
   ✓ Permissions granted:
     - contents: write
     - pull-requests: write
     - issues: write
   ✓ Job structure complete:
     - Record ripple event
     - Execute alignment check
     - Update sync state
     - Create evidence bundle
     - Commit tracking updates
   
   Result: PASS

2. Alignment Script: .github/scripts/align-governance.sh
   ✓ File exists
   ✓ Executable permissions set
   ✓ Executes without fatal errors
   ✓ Validates governance structure:
     - governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json: FOUND
     - governance/TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json: FOUND
     - .agent-admin/governance/sync_state.json: FOUND
   
   Result: PASS

3. Ripple Event Log: .agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json
   ✓ File exists
   ✓ Valid JSON syntax
   ✓ Schema version: 1.0.0
   ✓ Canonical source: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance
   ✓ Events array: initialized (empty)
   ✓ Initialization timestamp: 2026-02-14T12:53:20Z
   
   Result: PASS

4. Sync State: .agent-admin/governance/sync_state.json
   ✓ File exists
   ✓ Valid JSON syntax
   ✓ Alignment state: ALIGNED
   ✓ Last sync: 20260212T123732Z
   ✓ Canonical source: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance
   ✓ Drift detected: false
   
   Result: PASS

5. Governance Files
   ✓ governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json: EXISTS, valid JSON
   ✓ governance/TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json: EXISTS
   
   Result: PASS

PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE
-------------------

✓ CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md
  - Repository dispatch trigger configured
  - Event logging implemented
  - Sync state tracking implemented

✓ GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_MONITORING_PROTOCOL.md
  - Alignment script operational
  - Drift detection configured
  - Alignment PR creation on drift

✓ EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md
  - Evidence bundle directory structure
  - Structured evidence log
  - Files modified tracking
  - Validation results documentation

✓ LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0
  - Session memory protocol followed
  - Evidence artifact creation
  - Role boundaries maintained

OPERATIONAL READINESS
---------------------

Current Status: OPERATIONAL (Pending Default Branch Merge)

✓ All infrastructure components installed
✓ All configuration validated
✓ All tracking files initialized
✓ All scripts operational

⚠ PENDING: Merge to default branch
  GitHub only processes repository_dispatch events
  from workflows on the default branch.
  
  Action Required: Merge PR to activate ripple reception

TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------

Pre-Merge Testing:
✓ YAML syntax validation
✓ Alignment script execution
✓ Governance structure validation
✓ File integrity checks

Post-Merge Testing Required:
□ Manual workflow trigger via workflow_dispatch
□ Verify workflow execution in Actions tab
□ Request test ripple from canonical governance repo
□ Verify event receipt and processing
□ Verify ripple-log.json update
□ Verify sync_state.json update
□ Verify evidence bundle creation

SUMMARY
-------

Infrastructure Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Configuration Status: ✅ VALID
Operational Status: ⚠️ PENDING DEFAULT BRANCH MERGE
Documentation Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Evidence Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The governance ripple receiver is fully installed,
configured, and ready for operation. Once merged to
the default branch, the repository will automatically
receive and process governance ripple events from the
canonical governance repository.
