# Continuous Improvement Capture

**Status**: CAPTURED

## Session
- Date: 2026-02-12
- PR: PENDING (Unified Merge Gate Interface Implementation)
- Agent: foreman
- Timestamp: 20260212T123732Z

## Improvements Identified

1. **Standardized Gate Interface**
   - Replaced multiple repository-specific gates with unified interface
   - Improved predictability and consistency across repositories
   - Reduced maintenance burden through centralization

2. **Evidence-First Validation**
   - Implemented machine-readable gate results (JSON schema)
   - Eliminated manual log archaeology
   - Enabled deterministic gate evaluation

3. **Deterministic PR Classification**
   - Replaced inference-based classification with rule-based logic
   - Eliminated misapplication of agent-class requirements
   - Improved clarity for PR authors

4. **Foreman Infrastructure**
   - Established persistent memory and learning capability
   - Implemented wake-up/session closure protocols
   - Created escalation management framework

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created 10+ page migration guide
   - Documented all edge cases and troubleshooting
   - Established clear deprecation timeline

## Improvements Captured

All identified improvements have been implemented:

1. ✅ **Unified Workflow**: `.github/workflows/merge-gate-interface.yml`
   - Three standard jobs (verdict, alignment, enforcement)
   - Deterministic PR classification
   - Evidence-first validation pattern

2. ✅ **Foreman Protocols**: Wake-up and session closure scripts
   - Automatic memory management
   - Environment health monitoring
   - Governance state validation

3. ✅ **Evidence Bundle System**: Automation script and templates
   - Required directory structure
   - JSON schema validation
   - Improvements tracking

4. ✅ **Migration Documentation**: MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting
   - Step-by-step migration process
   - Deprecation timeline

5. ✅ **Workspace Infrastructure**: .agent-workspace/foreman/
   - Memory rotation (≤5 active sessions)
   - Personal learning files
   - Escalation inbox

## Improvements Parked

None - all identified improvements were implementable within current scope and authority.

## Rationale

This implementation represents a significant architectural improvement for the repository's governance infrastructure:

- **Standardization**: Aligns with Living Agent System v6.2.0 across all governed repositories
- **Maintainability**: Reduces gate maintenance burden through unified interface
- **Predictability**: Deterministic classification eliminates inference errors
- **Evidence-Based**: Machine-readable validation replaces manual inspection
- **Scalability**: Framework supports future gate enhancements without breaking changes

All improvements align with canonical governance requirements (MERGE_GATE_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md, EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md) and were within Foreman's autonomous authority per FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md.

## Future Considerations

1. **Post-Migration Monitoring**: Track gate behavior in first 5-10 PRs
2. **Legacy Gate Deprecation**: Execute deprecation timeline (Phase 2: 2026-03-12, Phase 3: 2026-04-12)
3. **Cross-Repository Learning**: Share lessons with other repositories migrating to v6.2.0
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Build on this experience for future gate improvements
