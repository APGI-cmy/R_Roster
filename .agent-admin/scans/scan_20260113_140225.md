### Tier-0 Constitutional Documents

1. **AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md**
   - Role: contract-modification-authority
   - Tier: 0
   - Status: Constitutional
   - Relevance: This task modifies agent contracts - must follow protocol

2. **EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md**
   - Referenced in issue as v2.0.0+ authority
   - Mandates PREHANDOVER_PROOF for all handovers
   - Defines Section 0 (4 governance artifacts) requirements
   - Defines CST validation framework (Section 9)

3. **COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md**
   - Version: v1.0.0
   - Referenced as authority for CST requirements
   - Defines Combined Systems Testing patterns

4. **BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md**
   - Supreme building authority
   - Architecture → QA → Build → Validation sequence
   - Immutable constitutional principle

5. **CONSTITUTIONAL_SANDBOX_PATTERN.md**

## Local Governance Review (R_Roster Repository)

### Templates

1. **governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md**
   - Version: 2.0.0
   - 718 lines (437% increase from v1.0.0)
   - Section 0: Four mandatory governance artifacts (Governance Scan, Risk Assessment, Change Record, Completion Summary)
   - Section 9: CST validation attestation framework (Path A: Required, Path B: Not Required, Path C: Uncertain)
   - Section 11: Comprehensive FAQ (645-702)
   - Status: Layered down in PR #26

### Agent Contracts (.github/agents/*.md)

**Current State Analysis**:
- 10 agent files total (including BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md)
- Some agents reference PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md but NOT v2.0.0
- Some agents have "Mandatory Process Improvement Reflection" sections
- **Gap**: No agents explicitly require Section 0 (4 governance artifacts)
- **Gap**: No agents explicitly require Section 9 (CST validation attestation)
- **Gap**: Not all agents have mandatory improvement proposal sections
- **Gap**: References to template don't specify v2.0.0 requirements

### Existing References Found:
- api-builder.md: Lines 183, 222, 225, 235, 239-268 (PREHANDOVER_PROOF + improvement reflection)
- integration-builder.md: Similar structure to api-builder
- qa-builder.md: Similar structure to api-builder  
- schema-builder.md: Similar structure to api-builder
- ui-builder.md: Similar structure to api-builder
- governance-liaison.md: Lines 62, 64, 98 (PREHANDOVER_PROOF reference)
- ForemanApp-agent.md: Line 345 (PREHANDOVER_PROOF enforcement)
- CodexAdvisor-agent.md: Lines 279-293 (PREHANDOVER_PROOF awareness)
- BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md: Lines 639-681 (improvement reflection schema)

## Task Requirements Analysis

**Issue**: Agent file alignment: v2.0.0 PREHANDOVER_PROOF + mandatory improvement proposals

### Requirement 1: Align with v2.0.0 Template
- Require all 4 governance artifacts (Section 0)
- Require CST validation attestation (Section 9)
- Reference v2.0.0 template location
- Update completion checklists
- Add "PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 Requirements" section

### Requirement 2: Enforce Mandatory Improvement Proposal
- Add COMPULSORY improvement proposal section
- Mark as MANDATORY in completion templates
- Link to FM parking station for tracking
- Add enforcement note in admin file

### Affected Agents (9 files)
1. api-builder.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
2. qa-builder.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
3. ui-builder.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
4. schema-builder.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
5. integration-builder.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
6. governance-liaison.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
7. ForemanApp-agent.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment + enhancement
8. CodexAdvisor-agent.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment (advisory role - different pattern)
9. agent-contract-administrator.md - Needs v2.0.0 alignment (self-monitoring)

**Note**: BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md is a schema document, not an agent contract, but may need reference updates.
