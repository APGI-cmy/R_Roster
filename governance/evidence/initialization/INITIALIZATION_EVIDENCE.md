- [x] Created `governance/policies`
- [x] Created `governance/schemas`
- [x] Created `governance/memory`
- [x] Created `.architecture/commissioning`
- [x] Created `.architecture/parking-station`
- [x] Created `.qa/builder`
- [x] Created `.qa/gpca`
- [x] Created `.qa/evidence`
- [x] Created `docs/architecture`

### Phase 2: Core Governance Files
- [x] Created `BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md` (root)
- [x] Created `governance/alignment/GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT.md`
- [x] Created `governance/evidence/initialization/INITIALIZATION_EVIDENCE.md` (this file)

### Phase 3: PR Gate Workflows
- [x] Workflow placeholder created (`.github/workflows/governance-gate-placeholder.md`)
- [ ] Full workflow implementation deferred (requires tech stack determination)
- [x] Applicable gates determination documented in placeholder

### Phase 4: Agent Contracts
- [x] Agent contracts seeded (pre-existing in `.github/agents/`)
- [x] Created repository `.agent` contract at root

### Phase 5: Governance Policies & Schemas
- [x] Created `governance/schemas/CANONICAL_SCHEMAS.md` (references to governance repo)
- [x] Created `governance/policies/CANONICAL_POLICIES.md` (references to governance repo)

### Phase 6: Latest Learnings Integration
- [x] Reviewed BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md (BL-001 through BL-025)
- [x] Reviewed recent governance learnings
- [x] Documented learnings applied in `LATEST_LEARNINGS_APPLIED.md`

### Phase 7: Repository-Specific Mapping
- [ ] Governance gate mapping (deferred - tech stack dependent)
- [ ] Architecture documentation (deferred - application not yet developed)

### Phase 8: Branch Protection & Commissioning
- [ ] Configure branch protection settings (requires GitHub UI or API)
- [x] Created `governance/evidence/commissioning/COMMISSIONING_READINESS.md`
- [x] Created root files: `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
- [x] Updated `README.md` with governance section

## Latest Learnings Applied

**Learnings Review Date**: 2026-01-11  
**Bootstrap Learnings Version**: BL-001 through BL-025 (Latest from maturion-foreman-governance)

### Key Learnings Incorporated:

1. **BL-024 - Constitutional Sandbox Pattern** - Agent judgment encouraged within constitutional boundaries (constitutional rules supreme, procedural guidance flexible)
2. **BL-022 - Policy NO-ONLY-LANGUAGE** - Ban minimizing language ("only X failing") - only acceptable status: "100% GREEN" or "NOT READY"
3. **BL-021 - Test Removal Governance Gate** - Zero-tolerance test removal policy with traceability requirements
4. **BL-020 - FM Pre-Authorization Checklist** - FM must execute pre-authorization checklist before wave/subwave authorization
5. **BL-018/BL-019 - QA Catalog Alignment** - Wave planning must verify QA Catalog; forward-scan ALL pending work after BL creation; second-time failures trigger TARP
6. **BL-015 - Architecture Wiring-Completeness** - Architecture must be wiring-complete, not just structurally complete
7. **BL-016 - Cognitive Capability & Escalation** - FM must self-recognize complexity limits and halt proactively
8. **BL-017 - Canonical Progress Recording** - Wave execution progress must be systematically recorded
9. **BL-009 through BL-013 - Platform Readiness** - Deterministic validation, scoped readiness, progressive activation, operational enforcement evidence
10. **BL-001 through BL-008 - Foundational Governance** - Governance stabilization, readiness/execution separation, canonical identity, PR gate prerequisites

**Full Documentation**: See `governance/evidence/initialization/LATEST_LEARNINGS_APPLIED.md` for comprehensive learning integration details.

**Incidents Reviewed**: None specific to this repository (new initialization)

---

**Status**: Initialization Substantially Complete  
**Next Step**: Complete remaining items (branch protection configuration, tech stack-specific workflows)  
**Completion Target**: 2026-01-11 (core layer-down complete)

## Remaining Items (Deferred)

### Requires GitHub Configuration (Manual or API)
- Branch protection settings (must be configured via GitHub UI or API)

### Requires Tech Stack Determination
- Full PR gate workflows (depends on technology choice: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Governance gate mapping (application-specific)

### Requires Application Development
- Architecture documentation (application not yet developed)
- Repository-specific QA patterns (depends on application architecture)

## Layer-Down Status

**FPC Phases 1-6**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**FPC Phases 7-8**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** (core files done, configuration items deferred)

**Overall Assessment**: Governance layer-down **substantially complete** per FPC guide. Remaining items are configuration-dependent or require application context not yet available.
