**Last Learning Reviewed**: BL-025 (2026-01-09)

## Learning Categories Applied

### Critical Constitutional Learnings

#### BL-024: Constitutional Sandbox Pattern (2026-01-09)
**Impact**: Transformative governance model  
**Key Principle**: Constitutional rules (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, Zero Test Debt, 100% GREEN) are supreme authority. Agent judgment and flexibility ENCOURAGED within constitutional boundaries to optimize execution, as long as constitutional boundaries are NEVER violated.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md references constitutional vs procedural hierarchy
- Agents may exercise judgment within constitutional sandbox
- Constitutional compliance mandatory; process optimization encouraged

#### BL-022: Policy NO-ONLY-LANGUAGE (2026-01-08)
**Impact**: Ban minimizing language when describing failures  
**Key Principle**: Only acceptable status: "100% GREEN" or "NOT READY - X failing". Minimizing language ("only", "just", "minor") enables test dodging.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- Status reporting must use accurate language
- No minimizing failures or technical debt
- Referenced in governance policies

#### BL-021: Test Removal Governance Gate (2026-01-08)
**Impact**: Zero-tolerance test removal policy  
**Key Principle**: Test removal requires traceability analysis, impact assessment, and governance approval. Tests map to architectural requirements, not implementation classes.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- Test removal requires governance gate process
- Traceability methodology documented
- Referenced in canonical policies

### Wave Planning & Execution Learnings

#### BL-018/BL-019: QA Catalog Alignment (2026-01-05)
**Impact**: Catastrophic/Emergency - Second-time failure prohibition  
**Key Principle**: Wave planning MUST verify QA Catalog before subwave assignment. Forward-scan ALL pending work after ANY BL creation.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- QA catalog alignment required for any wave-based planning
- Forward-scan mandatory after learnings
- TARP activation for second-time failures

#### BL-020: FM Pre-Authorization Checklist (2026-01-05)
**Impact**: FM authorization structural defense  
**Key Principle**: FM MUST execute pre-authorization checklist before authorizing waves/subwaves or appointing builders.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- FM pre-authorization checklist referenced
- Authorization blocked without checklist PASS
- Mandatory for all builder appointments

#### BL-025: Combined Subwave/Wave Testing (2026-01-09)
**Impact**: Strategic integration assurance  
**Key Principle**: CST at convergence points (strategic), CWT before IBWR (mandatory).

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- If multi-wave builds adopted, CST/CWT required
- CWT mandatory before IBWR
- Strategic integration gates expected

### Platform Readiness Learnings

#### BL-009 through BL-013: Platform Readiness Model
**Impact**: Platform readiness must be deterministic, scoped, progressive  
**Key Principles**: 
- Readiness requires deterministic validation (not subjective)
- Distinguish governance-layer vs per-repository readiness
- AMBER requires explicit exception criteria
- Model progressive activation stages
- "Operational" requires enforcement evidence

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- Repository initialization evidence uses deterministic criteria
- Commissioning follows progressive activation
- Evidence-based readiness validation
- Operational status requires enforcement proof

### Architecture & QA Learnings

#### BL-015: Architecture Wiring-Completeness (2025-12-31)
**Impact**: Architecture must guarantee functional completeness  
**Key Principle**: Architecture must be wiring-complete, not just structurally complete. Every component must have explicit operational definition.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- When architecture created, wiring-completeness required
- No "summary-only" architecture sections
- All components must map to numbered QA

#### BL-016: Cognitive Capability & Escalation (2026-01-03)
**Impact**: FM must self-recognize execution complexity limits  
**Key Principle**: FM has obligation and authority to halt/pause based on complexity assessment, not just specific failures.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- FM may halt for complexity reasons proactively
- Execution pressure signals filtered through FM judgment
- Complexity-aware escalation expected

#### BL-017: Canonical Progress Recording (2026-01-04)
**Impact**: Wave execution progress must be systematically recorded  
**Key Principle**: FM MUST maintain canonical progress record per wave. Wave closure requires evidence-based certification.

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- If wave-based execution adopted, progress artifact mandatory
- Artifact indexing (name → path → status) required
- Wave closure blocked without certified completion

### Early Bootstrap Learnings

#### BL-001 through BL-008: Foundational Governance
**Principles Applied**:
- Governance stabilization before FM recruitment (BL-001)
- Readiness certification vs execution authority separation (BL-002)
- Canonical FM identity required (BL-003)
- Bootstrap execution proxy is governance-safe (BL-004)
- Runtime execution monitor need identified (BL-005/BL-006)
- Irresponsible appointment collapses model (BL-007)
- PR gate layer-down mandatory prerequisite (BL-008)

**Applied to R_Roster**:
- Governance layer-down completed before agent activation
- Agent recruitment deferred until initialization complete
- PR gates to be installed before builder appointments
- Repository .agent contract established

## Summary of Application

**Constitutional Bindings**:
- ✅ BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md at root (supreme authority)
- ✅ Zero Test Debt mandate recognized
- ✅ 100% GREEN philosophy established
- ✅ Constitutional Sandbox Pattern applied
- ✅ Governance Supremacy Rule (GSR) binding

**Process Learnings**:
- ✅ FM pre-authorization checklist referenced
