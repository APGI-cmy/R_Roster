**Task**: Per-Repo FPC Realignment and Governance Pointer Check (R_Roster)

**Status**: COMPLETE (structure alignment)  
**Agent**: Governance Liaison v2.0.0

## Evaluation of Governance Improvements

As required by **MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_DOCTRINE.md**, after task completion, agent must evaluate whether governance improvements were discovered.

### Assessment

**Question**: Were any governance improvements, process enhancements, or systemic issues identified during this realignment?

**Answer**: **None identified for governance canon modification**

### Justification

This task was explicitly scoped as:
- **Pointer and metadata realignment only**
- **No changes to governance content or meaning**
- Following existing FPC guide and governance restructure

The task executed as intended:
1. ✅ All governance references updated correctly
2. ✅ FPC structure compliance achieved
3. ✅ Documentation created as specified
4. ✅ Cross-repo coordination requirements documented
5. ✅ No blockers encountered that require governance changes

### Observations (Non-Governance)

The following observations are **NOT governance improvements** but operational notes:

1. **Documentation Quality**: The FPC guide provided clear structure requirements. All directories and READMEs were straightforward to create.

2. **Pointer Updates**: The split between `generic_canon_path` and `repo_specific_path` in YAML frontmatter is clear and unambiguous.

3. **Cross-Repo Verification**: The need for manual verification in the governance repository is correctly identified and documented in events.

4. **Structure Before Content**: Creating FPC-compliant structure before implementing workflows/validators follows proper sequence.

### Governance Process Quality

The realignment process worked as designed:
- Clear scope definition (pointers/metadata only)
- Explicit prohibition on content changes (followed correctly)
- Cross-repo coordination documented (not executed unilaterally)
- Escalation path clear (Johan/Governance Administrator)

**No process improvements needed for this task type.**
