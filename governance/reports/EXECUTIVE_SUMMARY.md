# R_ROSTER GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date**: 2026-01-10  
**Status**: ❌ **BUILD AUTHORIZATION BLOCKED**  
**Analyst**: Governance Liaison Agent

---

## Critical Finding

**R_Roster is NOT governance-aligned. ALL BUILD ACTIVITIES BLOCKED.**

The repository lacks **7 critical governance requirements** and would **FAIL** the INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.

---

## What This Means

### ❌ Cannot Proceed With:
- Architecture design
- Builder appointments
- Code implementation
- Feature development
- Any development work

### ✅ Can Proceed With:
- Governance structure setup
- Repository initialization
- PR gate implementation

---

## Why This Matters

Without proper governance:
- **No Build Philosophy** - Agents lack canonical build discipline reference
- **No Enforcement** - Cannot validate 100% GREEN, zero-test-debt, or build-to-green
- **No Protection** - No PR gates to prevent governance violations
- **No Evidence** - Cannot prove proper initialization or authorization

---

## Critical Gaps (Must Fix Immediately)

1. **BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md** - Supreme authority document (MISSING)
2. **governance/** - Directory structure (MISSING)
3. **.architecture/** - Architecture/evidence directory (MISSING)
4. **.qa/** - QA evidence directory (MISSING)
5. **.github/workflows/** - PR gate workflows (MISSING)
6. **.gitignore, .env.example** - Configuration files (MISSING)
7. **Initialization Evidence** - Audit trail (MISSING)

---

## Comparison with Peer Repositories

| Repository | Governance Status |
|------------|-------------------|
| **FM (maturion-foreman-office-app)** | ✅ FULLY ALIGNED |
| **PartPulse** | ✅ ALIGNED |
| **R_Roster** | ❌ NOT ALIGNED |

**Conclusion**: R_Roster has **ZERO layering parity** with governed repositories.

## Remediation Required

### Phase 1: Critical Initialization (IMMEDIATE)
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Outcome**: INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE = GREEN

**Tasks**:
- Create all mandatory directories
- Implement BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
- Create GOVERNANCE_VERSION.md
- Implement PR gate workflows
- Create initialization evidence
- Obtain Johan's authorization

### Phase 2: Governance Enforcement (HIGH)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Outcome**: Full governance enforcement capability

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (RECOMMENDED)
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Outcome**: Feature parity with FM

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Johan Reviews** - Review formal gap analysis report
2. **Johan Authorizes** - Authorize Phase 1 remediation to begin
3. **Governance Liaison Executes** - Implement all critical governance artifacts
4. **Johan Approves** - Approve initialization evidence
5. **Johan Authorizes Architecture** - Separate decision after initialization

### Prohibited Actions:

- ❌ Do NOT begin architecture work
- ❌ Do NOT appoint builders
- ❌ Do NOT start implementation
- ❌ Do NOT bypass initialization requirements
