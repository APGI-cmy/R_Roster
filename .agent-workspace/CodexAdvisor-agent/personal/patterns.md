- Response: Fetch from canonical main branch, adapt minimally for local context, preserve source citations

## Pattern: Agent Contract Gold-Standard Compliance
- Observed: 2026-02-11 (Session 001)
- Context: Validating agent contracts against comprehensive requirement checklists

## Pattern: Migration Path for Contract Updates
- Observed: 2026-02-12 (Session 002)
