- Include multiple RAEC behavioral examples
- Reference 5 required canonical documents with SHA identifiers
- Comply with consumer repository prohibitions
- Update CANON_INVENTORY.json
- Verify checklist compliance against BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md

## What I Did

### Files Modified
1. **Created**: `.github/agents/BuilderApp-agent.md`
   - SHA256: 6ab51b4cc0a83d38e61bd8a55c24ce4410f4d1d77d12d0a16a68e718319bb5d6
   - Size: 26,503 bytes (856 lines)
   - 4-phase canonical architecture implemented

2. **Modified**: `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
   - Added AGENT-004 (BuilderApp-agent)
   - Added AGENT-005 through AGENT-009 (individual builder contracts)
   - Updated agent_contract_coverage
   - Updated timestamps and notes

### Actions Taken
1. **Repository Analysis**:
   - Reviewed existing builder contracts (api-builder, ui-builder, qa-builder, schema-builder, integration-builder)
   - Reviewed BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md (68 items)
   - Reviewed ForemanApp-agent.md as reference implementation
   - Identified 5 canonical documents to reference with SHA identifiers

2. **BuilderApp-agent.md Creation**:
   - Implemented YAML frontmatter with all required fields
   - Created Phase 1: Preflight with Identity, Authority, LOCKED self-modification prohibition
   - Added 5 comprehensive RAEC behavioral examples:
     * Architecture-first enforcement (wrong vs. correct)
     * Zero-test-debt enforcement (wrong vs. correct)
     * Self-modification prohibition (wrong vs. correct)
     * Architecture freeze respect (wrong vs. correct)
     * QA bypass prevention
   - Created Phase 2: Induction with wake-up protocol and governance loading
   - Created Phase 3: Build with execution requirements, builder specializations, consumer mode
   - Created Phase 4: Handover with session memory protocol and memory rotation
   - Referenced 5 canonical documents:
     * AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md (SHA: 6077885d...)
     * AGENT_PREFLIGHT_PATTERN.md (SHA: 611ddfd8...)
     * AGENT_PRIORITY_SYSTEM.md (SHA: d6251a95...)
     * AGENT_INDUCTION_PROTOCOL.md (SHA: 756f6c64...)
     * AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md (SHA: d5fcd80e...)

3. **CANON_INVENTORY.json Updates**:
   - Computed SHA256 hashes for all builder contracts
   - Added BuilderApp-agent.md as unified builder template (AGENT-004)
   - Added individual builder entries with metadata (AGENT-005 through AGENT-009)
   - Updated agent_contract_coverage with all builder bindings
   - Added comprehensive notes documenting builder contract alignment

4. **Validation**:
   - Verified 100% checklist compliance (65/65 applicable items, 3 N/A OPOJD items)
   - Verified all 5 canonical documents referenced with SHA identifiers
   - Verified 5 RAEC behavioral examples provided
   - Verified file size within limits (26,503 bytes < 30,000)
   - Ran code review (✅ No issues)
   - Ran CodeQL security scan (✅ No applicable changes)

### Decisions Made
1. **Unified Template Approach**: Created BuilderApp-agent.md as unified template while keeping individual builder contracts for specialization
   - Rationale: BuilderApp provides canonical pattern, individual builders allow for role-specific recruitment
   - Individual builders tracked in CANON_INVENTORY.json with proper bindings

2. **RAEC Example Coverage**: Provided 5 comprehensive behavioral examples covering key builder scenarios
   - Architecture-first enforcement (boundary check)
   - Zero-test-debt enforcement (quality gate)
   - Self-modification prohibition (constitutional requirement)
   - Architecture freeze respect (authority boundary)
   - QA bypass prevention (gate compliance)

3. **Consumer Mode Emphasis**: Explicitly documented consumer repository prohibitions
   - No governance modification
   - No bypassing governance alignment
   - No creating governance canon
   - No dispatching ripple events

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session memory (this file)
- Status: Complete

### Checklist Compliance
- Checklist: BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
- Compliance: 100% (65/65 applicable items)
- Verification: /tmp/checklist-verification.md created and validated

### Canonical Documents Referenced
- All 5 required canonical documents referenced with SHA identifiers
- Source: maturion-foreman-governance PRs #1147 and #1149
- Pattern: 4-phase canonical architecture (Preflight-Induction-Build-Handover)

### Ripple Status
- Status: Not applicable (creation of new agent contract)
- Ripple required: NO (local consumer repository change)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected
- BuilderApp-agent.md fills template gap for builder contracts

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- CANON_INVENTORY.json properly updated
- All SHA256 hashes computed and validated
- No placeholder or truncated hashes
- Timestamps updated

## Outcome

1. BuilderApp-agent.md - Unified Builder contract with 4-phase canonical architecture
2. Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json - All builder contracts tracked with SHA256 hashes

**Compliance**:
- ✅ 100% checklist compliance
- ✅ 4-phase canonical architecture
- ✅ RAEC operating model with 5 behavioral examples
- ✅ Self-modification prohibition
- ✅ Zero-test-debt enforcement
- ✅ Consumer repository mode prohibitions

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Reference Pattern Usage**: Using ForemanApp-agent.md as reference accelerated creation
   - Same YAML structure, phase organization, and RAEC pattern
   - Consistent with existing canonical architecture

2. **Systematic Checklist Verification**: Creating explicit verification document ensured completeness
   - Line-by-line mapping to checklist requirements
   - Clear compliance tracking (65/65 applicable items)

3. **Multiple RAEC Examples**: Providing 5 comprehensive wrong/correct behavioral examples
   - Covers key builder scenarios (architecture, QA, self-modification, authority)
   - Shows both anti-patterns and correct RAEC responses

4. **SHA256 Hash Tracking**: Computing and tracking all builder contract hashes
   - Ensures CANON_INVENTORY.json integrity
   - Provides audit trail for contract versions

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balancing Unified vs. Specialized Contracts**: Deciding whether to replace or supplement individual builders
   - Solution: BuilderApp as unified template, individual builders for specialization
   - Both tracked in CANON_INVENTORY.json

2. **RAEC Example Coverage**: Ensuring behavioral examples covered key scenarios
   - Solution: 5 examples covering architecture, QA, self-modification, authority boundaries
   - Each with wrong (anti-pattern) and correct (RAEC) approaches

3. **Consumer Mode Prohibitions**: Ensuring all consumer repository requirements documented
   - Solution: Explicit prohibitions section in Phase 3: Build
   - Clear distinction between consumer capabilities and prohibitions

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **4-Phase Canonical Architecture Pattern**: Well-established pattern for agent contracts
   - Phase 1: Preflight (Identity, Authority, LOCKED, RAEC Examples, Canonical References)
   - Phase 2: Induction (Wake-Up Protocol, Governance Loading)
   - Phase 3: Build (Execution, Specializations, Consumer Mode)
   - Phase 4: Handover (Session Memory, Memory Rotation)

2. **RAEC Behavioral Examples**: Critical for agent contract quality
   - Provide wrong (anti-pattern) examples first
   - Show correct RAEC response
   - Cover key scenarios (architecture, QA, self-modification, authority)

3. **Checklist Compliance Verification**: Systematic verification ensures completeness
   - Map contract sections to checklist items
   - Track compliance percentage
   - Document N/A items with rationale

4. **CANON_INVENTORY.json Structure**: Standard pattern for agent contract tracking
   - Compute SHA256 hashes for all files
   - Include metadata (version, contract_pattern, operating_model, self_modification_prohibited)
   - Update timestamps and notes
   - Track agent_contract_coverage

### Governance Insights
1. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 Maturity**: Well-defined canonical architecture pattern
   - 4-phase structure is repeatable across agent types
   - RAEC operating model is well-understood
   - Consumer repository mode is clearly defined

2. **Builder Contract Template**: BuilderApp-agent.md serves as canonical template
   - Can guide future builder contract creation
   - Demonstrates full checklist compliance
   - Shows comprehensive RAEC behavioral examples

3. **Canonical Documents**: 5 core documents define agent contract architecture
   - AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md (structure)
   - AGENT_PREFLIGHT_PATTERN.md (behavior)
   - AGENT_PRIORITY_SYSTEM.md (authority)
   - AGENT_INDUCTION_PROTOCOL.md (wake-up)
   - AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md (memory)
