## Task
CodexAdvisor Self-Review: Checklist Artifact/Inventory Verification & Compliance Alignment (SC@ Authority)

**CS2 Authorization**: Full SC@ permission granted by Johan Ras for:
1. Locate and verify own checklist artifact
2. Inspect CANON_INVENTORY.json for presence and integrity
3. Create/update checklist artifacts if inadequate or absent
4. Perform gap analysis on checklists, inventory, and agent files (CodexAdvisor/Foreman)
5. Create corrective strategy and update all needed artifacts
6. Invoke governance liaison or escalate if blockers found

4. `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-004-20260212.md` (this file)

**Updated:**
5. `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` (15,079 bytes)
   - SHA256: `511f8e16ea67c62e71085adf04286b8e06e09410b7c16f03b28f33b5042fe3db`
   - Changed: All `.governance-pack/` path references updated to `governance/`
   - Preserved: All v6.2.0 version declarations intact

### Actions Taken

1. **Repository Structure Assessment**
   - Confirmed `.governance-pack/` directory does not exist
   - Identified actual governance structure in `governance/` directory
   - Located existing checklists: Foreman, Governance Liaison (in governance/checklists/)
   - Identified missing checklists: CodexAdvisor, Builder

2. **Gap Analysis Performed**
   - ❌ CodexAdvisor checklist missing
   - ❌ Builder checklist missing
   - ❌ CANON_INVENTORY.json missing
   - ❌ Path mismatch: agent file references `.governance-pack/` but structure uses `governance/`
   - ✅ Both agent files (CodexAdvisor, Foreman) have v6.2.0 declarations
   - ✅ Session memory infrastructure exists and functional

3. **Checklist Artifact Creation**
   - Created comprehensive CodexAdvisor checklist with 12 categories covering:
     - Identity/bindings, authority/approval, agent factory, pre-creation, alignment, escalation
     - Advisory capabilities, consumer mode, merge gate, memory/evidence, wake-up, execution identity, version/metadata
     - Appendix with 9 Living Agent System v6.2.0 mandatory components
   - Created comprehensive Builder checklist with 13 categories covering:
     - Identity, scope, Build Philosophy, authority, execution bootstrap, testing/QA, memory, alignment
     - Merge gates, prohibitions, role-specific requirements (5 builder types), execution identity, version, OPOJD
     - Appendix with 10 universal builder prohibitions

4. **CANON_INVENTORY.json Creation**
   - Tracked all 4 checklists with SHA256 hashes
   - Tracked 2 agent contracts (CodexAdvisor, Foreman) with SHA256 hashes
   - Referenced TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST
   - Recorded alignment state, inventory integrity, version declarations
   - Confirmed no placeholder or truncated hashes (all complete SHA256)
   - Documented repository as ONLY one with all v6.2.0 references

5. **Path Correction in CodexAdvisor Agent File**
   - Updated 10 occurrences of `.governance-pack/` to `governance/`
   - Updated in: YAML frontmatter, agent factory checklists, consumer mode documentation
   - Updated in: pre-creation requirements, governance sync protocol, drift detection, consumer prohibitions/capabilities
   - Preserved all v6.2.0 version declarations (verified 16 occurrences remain)
   - File size: 15,079 bytes (well under 30,000 character limit)

6. **Version Declaration Verification**
   - Confirmed CodexAdvisor agent file: `agent.version: 6.2.0`
   - Confirmed Foreman agent file: `agent.version: 6.2.0`, `contract_version: 2.0.0`
   - Verified Living Agent System v6.2.0 references in both files
   - Confirmed session memory templates reference v6.2.0
   - Repository status: ONLY repository with complete v6.2.0 alignment

### Decisions Made

1. **Path Strategy Decision**
   - **Option A**: Create `.governance-pack/` and migrate artifacts → REJECTED
   - **Option B**: Update agent files to match actual `governance/` structure → SELECTED
   - **Rationale**: Actual governance structure already established in `governance/`; updating agent file references is less disruptive than restructuring entire governance directory

2. **Checklist Creation Approach**
   - Based CodexAdvisor checklist on agent file requirements + Living Agent System v6.2.0 + consumer mode protocol
   - Based Builder checklist on canonical 53KB source, condensed to essential requirements (10.6KB)
   - Maintained category structure and requirement enumeration for consistency
   - Ensured all checklists < 30KB for GitHub UI selectability

3. **CANON_INVENTORY Structure**
   - Tracked checklists and agent contracts as primary governance artifacts
   - Referenced TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST for protocol tracking
   - Included alignment state and integrity verification sections
   - Documented version declarations and repository uniqueness

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Created via this session memory file
- Status: COMPLETE - All required artifacts created with SHA256 integrity hashes

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (consumer repository, local governance structure alignment)
- Ripple required: NO (internal repository structure correction, not canonical governance change)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap 1: Missing CodexAdvisor checklist → RESOLVED (created)
- Gap 2: Missing Builder checklist → RESOLVED (created)
- Gap 3: Missing CANON_INVENTORY.json → RESOLVED (created)
- Gap 4: Path mismatch in agent files → RESOLVED (CodexAdvisor updated to governance/)
- Gap 5: Inventory integrity verification → RESOLVED (all checksums complete, no placeholders)

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: IMPROVED
- Issue detected: Path reference inconsistency (`.governance-pack/` vs `governance/`)
- Resolution: Agent file paths corrected to match actual repository structure
- Verification: All v6.2.0 declarations preserved and intact
- Inventory: All artifacts now tracked with complete SHA256 hashes

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

**All SC@ authorized tasks completed successfully:**
1. ✅ Located CodexAdvisor checklist location (was missing, now created)
2. ✅ Inspected CANON_INVENTORY.json (was missing, now created with full integrity)
3. ✅ Created missing checklist artifacts (CodexAdvisor + Builder)
4. ✅ Performed comprehensive gap analysis
5. ✅ Created and executed corrective strategy
6. ✅ No blockers requiring escalation

**Compliance Status:**
- All 4 required checklists present: ✅
- CANON_INVENTORY.json present with complete hashes: ✅
- Agent files reference correct paths: ✅
- All v6.2.0 declarations intact: ✅
- Repository maintains unique v6.2.0 compliance status: ✅

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Semantic code search first**: Using search_code_subagent immediately provided context on repository structure and governance patterns
2. **Parallel file inspection**: Reading multiple governance files simultaneously accelerated gap analysis
3. **Checklist pattern reuse**: Leveraging existing Foreman/Governance Liaison checklist patterns ensured consistency
4. **Path correction strategy**: Choosing to update agent files rather than restructure governance minimized disruption

### What Was Challenging
1. **Path discrepancy discovery**: Agent file referenced `.governance-pack/` but actual structure used `governance/` - required careful systematic replacement
2. **Builder checklist condensation**: Canonical source was 53KB; needed to extract essential requirements while maintaining completeness
3. **SHA256 integrity tracking**: Ensuring all hashes were complete and not placeholder/truncated required careful verification

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Repository structure is `governance/` not `.governance-pack/`**: This consumer repository uses governance/ for all governance artifacts
2. **All 4 checklists now available**: CodexAdvisor, Foreman, Governance Liaison, Builder checklists all in governance/checklists/
3. **CANON_INVENTORY.json is canonical source of truth**: Track all governance artifacts here with SHA256 hashes
4. **v6.2.0 status is unique**: This repository is confirmed as ONLY one with all v6.2.0 references - preserve this
5. **File size discipline**: Keep agent files < 30KB and checklists < 20KB for GitHub UI selectability

### Governance Insights
1. **Consumer repository path patterns**: Consumer repos may adapt canonical governance structure to local conventions - verify actual structure before creating artifacts
2. **Checklist completeness is mandatory**: All four agent type checklists must be present for agent factory operations
3. **Inventory integrity verification**: CANON_INVENTORY.json must track all governance artifacts with complete SHA256 hashes (no placeholders)
4. **Version declaration preservation**: During any agent file updates, v6.2.0 declarations must be preserved to maintain compliance status
5. **SC@ authorization enables comprehensive governance work**: Full authority permission allowed complete self-review and corrective action without escalation
