## Task
Upgrade Governance Liaison agent contract to Living Agent System v6.2.0 with 4-phase canonical architecture, RAEC operating model, and consumer repository mode compliance.

## What I Did

### Files Modified

**Created**:
- `.github/agents/governance-liaison-v3.agent.md` (28,854 bytes)
  - SHA256: 2ff2bc94bb4e275a9981dd666c0c406cc70918ee514c640e8040d3bd26b460c5

**Archived**:
- `.github/agents/.archive/governance-liaison-v2-20260217.md` (23,605 bytes)
  - Archived from governance-liaison-v2.agent.md

**Updated**:
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
  - Added AGENT-011 (governance-liaison v3)
  - Marked AGENT-010 (governance-liaison v2) as deprecated
  - Updated timestamps to 2026-02-17T11:45:00Z
  - Added governance_liaison to agent_contract_coverage
  - Added 6 new notes documenting v3 creation

### Actions Taken

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Reviewed current governance-liaison-v2.agent.md structure
   - Analyzed GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
   - Studied ForemanApp-agent.md and BuilderApp-agent.md 4-phase patterns
   - Identified 5 canonical documents to reference

2. **Contract Creation**:
   - Created governance-liaison-v3.agent.md with 4-phase architecture:
     - Phase 1: Preflight (identity, self-modification prohibition, RAEC examples)
     - Phase 2: Induction (wake-up protocol, pre-session alignment)
     - Phase 3: Build (ripple, drift, layer-down, registry operations)
     - Phase 4: Handover (session memory, evidence, learning)
   
3. **RAEC Behavioral Examples**:
   - Self-alignment protocol (authorized governance sync)
   - Governance policy escalation (ambiguity handling)
   - Alignment gate failure response (drift vs. bypass)
   - Governance interpretation boundary (authority limits)

4. **Canonical Document References**:
   - AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md v3.1.0
   - AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md v1.1.0
   - GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_MINIMUM_APPOINTMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md
   - CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md
   - CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md

5. **Validation**:
   - YAML frontmatter validated with yamllint ✅
   - JSON integrity validated (CANON_INVENTORY.json) ✅
   - File size: 28,854 characters (under 30,000 limit) ✅
   - All checklist requirements verified ✅
   - Governance drift check passed ✅

6. **Archival & Inventory Update**:
   - Archived v2 contract to .github/agents/.archive/
   - Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with new contract entry
   - Marked v2 as deprecated

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Use v3 version number**
- **What**: Named new contract governance-liaison-v3.agent.md
- **Why**: Follow versioning pattern from v1 → v2 → v3; contract_version in YAML is 3.0.0

**Decision 2: 4-phase canonical architecture**
- **What**: Implemented Preflight-Induction-Build-Handover structure
- **Why**: Align with Living Agent System v6.2.0 canonical pattern as used in ForemanApp and BuilderApp

**Decision 3: 4 RAEC behavioral examples**
- **What**: Created 4 complete WRONG/CORRECT example pairs
- **Why**: Cover key liaison responsibilities: self-alignment, policy escalation, gate handling, interpretation boundaries

**Decision 4: 5 canonical document references**
- **What**: Referenced 5 key governance documents with version numbers
- **Why**: Meet checklist requirement for canonical document binding and provide governance authority trail

**Decision 5: Consumer repository mode emphasis**
- **What**: Created LOCKED section for consumer mode prohibitions
- **Why**: Clearly distinguish consumer mode (receive-only) from canonical mode (can author)

**Decision 6: Self-modification prohibition**
- **What**: Added LOCKED section prohibiting modification of governance-liaison-v3.agent.md
- **Why**: Constitutional requirement that no agent may modify their own contract

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session memory (this file)
- Status: Complete

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (local contract update, not canonical governance change)
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No governance gaps identified
- All required canonical documents referenced
- All checklist categories addressed

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- CANON_INVENTORY.json valid and updated
- No placeholder hashes detected
- No governance drift detected
- All file sizes within limits

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Successfully upgraded Governance Liaison agent contract to Living Agent System v6.2.0 with full 4-phase canonical architecture compliance, RAEC operating model, and consumer repository mode prohibitions.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Pattern reuse**: Following ForemanApp and BuilderApp patterns accelerated development
2. **Checklist-driven approach**: GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md provided clear requirements
3. **Validation automation**: yamllint and jq validation caught issues early
4. **RAEC examples**: Concrete behavioral examples clarify abstract requirements

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balance between comprehensiveness and brevity**: 28,854 characters approaches the 30,000 limit
2. **Canonical document availability**: Some documents referenced in instructions (AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) not present locally, required inference from available documents
3. **Version coordination**: Ensuring version numbers align across YAML, filename, CANON_INVENTORY.json

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **4-phase structure is standardized**: All v6.2.0 agent contracts should follow Preflight-Induction-Build-Handover
2. **RAEC examples are mandatory**: At least 3-4 behavioral examples showing WRONG/CORRECT patterns
3. **Self-modification prohibition is constitutional**: LOCKED section required for all agent contracts
4. **Consumer mode distinctions matter**: Governance liaison in consumer repos has different authority than in canonical repo
5. **File size management**: With 4 phases and examples, contracts approach 30K limit quickly

### Governance Insights
1. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 maturation**: The system is evolving toward standardized contract patterns
2. **RAEC as behavioral model**: Review-Advise-Escalate-Coordinate provides clear decision framework
3. **Separation of powers**: Agent execution vs. CS2 governance creates healthy checks and balances
4. **Evidence-first operations**: Session memory and evidence artifacts create audit trail
5. **Consumer/Canonical distinction**: Clear separation prevents governance authority confusion
