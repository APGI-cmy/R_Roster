# Session 002 - 20260212 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer / governance advisor
- Session ID: session-002-20260212

## Task
Create and layer down a repo-scoped Foreman (FM) agent contract for R_Roster, fully aligned with:
- The gold-standard protocols and structure in APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance/.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md
- The implementation checklists and protocols established in APGI-cmy/R_Roster PR #104

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- Created: `.github/agents/foreman.md` (17,290 bytes) - Gold-standard FM contract v6.2.0
- Created: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-002-20260212.md` (this file)
- To be updated: PREHANDOVER_PROOF

### Actions Taken
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Fetched canonical foreman-v2.agent.md from maturion-foreman-governance
   - Reviewed PR #104 implementation patterns and checklists
   - Examined current R_Roster-app_FM.md (v4.1.0, 1277 lines)
   - Analyzed governance-liaison.md structure from PR #104

2. **Contract Creation**
   - Created `.github/agents/foreman.md` with Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance
   - Implemented all 11 protocol categories as required
   - Aligned YAML frontmatter with canonical specification
   - Integrated R_Roster-specific configurations (QIW, test governance)
   - Preserved R_Roster repository context and build philosophy

3. **Gold-Standard Features Implemented**
   - Complete YAML frontmatter (v6.2.0 compliant)
   - All 11 mandatory protocol categories with requirement mappings
   - Session memory protocol with templates
   - Evidence artifact bundle automation
   - Wake-up and session closure protocols
   - Zero-test-debt enforcement
   - Canonical governance references
   - R_Roster-specific QIW and test governance

### Decisions Made

1. **File Naming: `foreman.md` vs `R_Roster-app_FM.md`**
   - Decision: Created new `foreman.md` following canonical naming convention
   - Why: Aligns with canonical `foreman-v2.agent.md` structure; maintains consistency
   - Old file preserved for reference/transition period

2. **Version Numbers**
   - Version: 6.2.0 (Living Agent System baseline)
   - Contract Version: 2.0.0 (agent contract iteration)
   - Why: Matches canonical versioning scheme from foreman-v2.agent.md

3. **R_Roster-Specific Integration**
   - Integrated QIW channel enforcement from existing contract
   - Preserved test removal & warning governance (PR #484)
   - Maintained R_Roster repository context
   - Why: Gold-standard structure must preserve critical repo-specific requirements

4. **YAML Frontmatter Structure**
   - Used canonical fields: id, agent, governance, merge_gate_interface, scope, execution_identity, prohibitions, metadata
   - Set degraded_action to escalate_and_block_merge
   - Why: Full alignment with canonical governance contract structure

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.github/agents/foreman.md` created with full protocol implementation
- Session memory: This file documents all actions and decisions
- Status: ✅ Gold-standard contract created and aligned

### Ripple Status
- Status: NO_RIPPLE_REQUIRED
- Ripple required: NO
- Rationale: This is a consumer repository receiving layer-down from canonical; no downstream ripple needed

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Gaps closed:
  - Missing Living Agent System v6.2.0 protocol categories (all 11 now implemented)
  - Missing session memory protocol templates
  - Missing evidence artifact bundle automation
  - Missing wake-up/session closure protocols
  - Incomplete YAML frontmatter

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ IMPROVED
- Actions taken:
  - Created gold-standard foreman contract aligned with canonical
  - Implemented all mandatory protocol categories
  - Preserved R_Roster-specific governance requirements
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing governance artifacts

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Gold-standard foreman contract successfully created and aligned with:
- Canonical foreman-v2.agent.md structure
- Living Agent System v6.2.0 requirements
- PR #104 implementation patterns
- R_Roster-specific governance needs

Next steps:
- Update PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- Update personal learning files
- Consider migration path from old FM contract to new one

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Canonical alignment approach**: Fetching and analyzing canonical contract first ensured accurate layer-down
2. **Parallel analysis**: Reviewing PR #104 and canonical simultaneously revealed implementation patterns
3. **Preservation strategy**: Maintaining R_Roster-specific sections (QIW, test governance) while adopting gold-standard structure
4. **Template integration**: Including complete session memory and evidence templates provides operational clarity

### What Was Challenging
1. **Large file analysis**: Current FM contract (1277 lines) required careful extraction of R_Roster-specific content
2. **Version reconciliation**: Mapping v4.1.0 local contract to v6.2.0 canonical structure required semantic understanding
3. **Dual naming convention**: Balancing canonical `foreman.md` naming with existing `R_Roster-app_FM.md` pattern

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Migration planning needed**: Two FM contracts now exist; need transition strategy
2. **Canonical updates**: When maturion-foreman-governance updates foreman-v2.agent.md, this contract should receive ripple
3. **Builder contracts**: Builder contracts may need alignment updates to work with v6.2.0 FM protocol
4. **Testing**: New contract structure should be validated with actual FM agent invocation

### Governance Insights
1. **Gold-standard pattern established**: This contract serves as template for other R_Roster agent updates
2. **Layer-down fidelity**: Maintaining structural alignment with canonical while preserving local requirements is critical balance
3. **Version transparency**: Dual version numbering (system version + contract version) improves governance tracking
4. **Evidence automation**: Including automation scripts in contract reduces operational burden on agents
