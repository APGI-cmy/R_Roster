# Session 003 - 20260212 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: PR-114-R_Roster-v6.2.0-upgrade

## Task
Upgrade CodexAdvisor agent file in R_Roster from 40% to 100% Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance using minimal enhancement approach.

## What I Did
### Files Modified
- `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` (15,191 chars, 49.4% buffer under 30K limit)

### Actions Taken
- ✅ Added machine-readable `file_size_limit` block with BLOCKING enforcement
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive checklist binding (4 role-specific checklists)
- ✅ Added CS2 authorization model with explicit prohibitions
- ✅ Documented consumer repository mode differences
- ✅ Created 6-step pre-creation protocol
- ✅ Established Living Agent System v6.2.0 template structure (9 components)
- ✅ Reorganized constraints (30K limit as CRITICAL first item, consolidated to 7 items)
- ✅ Character count: 15,191 / 30,000 (49.4% buffer)

### Decisions Made
- **Minimal enhancement approach**: Surgical changes (+27 lines, -3 lines) instead of full rewrite
  - **Why**: Preserves working structure, reduces merge risk, faster review
- **Machine-readable 30K enforcement**: YAML block + CRITICAL constraint + FAIL_VALIDATION
  - **Why**: Enables programmatic validation, prevents GitHub UI selectability issues
- **Consumer mode clarity**: Explicit section documenting differences from canonical mode
  - **Why**: Prevents governance path confusion (`.governance-pack/` vs `governance/`)
- **6-step pre-creation protocol**: Including checklist/inventory verification
  - **Why**: Prevents common failures (missing checklists, degraded canon)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Character Count Management
- **Pre-creation estimate**: ~15,700 characters (target with 47.7% buffer)
- **Final count**: 15,191 characters (49.4% buffer under 30K limit)
- **Strategy**: Minimal enhancement rather than full template embedding

### Pattern Applied
**✅ CORRECT**: Minimal surgical enhancements → 15,191 chars (50.6% of limit)  
**❌ WRONG** (other PRs): Embed full templates → 33,500+ chars (112% of limit)

### Compliance Metrics
- **Before**: 40% compliant (missing checklist binding, 30K enforcement, pre-creation protocol)
- **After**: 100% compliant (all v6.2.0 requirements satisfied)
- **Change footprint**: +27 lines, -3 lines (net +24 lines)

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session memory created (this file)
- Status: Complete with RCA

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (consumer repository, receive-only)
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Agent-Factory Protocol upgraded from 40% to 100%
- Gaps addressed: 30K enforcement, checklist references, Requirements section

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Session memory creation failure detected and corrected
- Hygiene issues detected: Recurring pattern - failed session memory in PR #76 and PR #114

## Root Cause Analysis: Session Memory Failure

### Failure Description
**I failed to create session memory for this PR initially.** This is a **recurring pattern** - same failure occurred in maturion-isms PR #76.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Trigger**: I did not recognize "agent file recompilation" as requiring session memory
   - **Gap**: Session memory protocol not integrated into agent-factory workflow
   - **Evidence**: Two consecutive PRs (#76, #114) both failed to create session memory

2. **Checklist Gap**: Living Agent System v6.2.0 template checklist does not explicitly require session memory creation
   - **Gap**: Session memory is mentioned in protocol but not enforced in pre-creation steps
   - **Evidence**: 6-step pre-creation protocol (lines 325-350) does not include "Create session memory"

3. **Pattern Recognition Failure**: I did not apply lessons from PR #76 failure
   - **Gap**: Self-learning loop not activated automatically
   - **Evidence**: PR #78 corrected PR #76, but I repeated the same failure in PR #114

4. **Authority Model Interpretation**: I interpreted CS2 authorization as "permission to create agent file" not "permission to complete full v6.2.0 protocol"
   - **Gap**: Living Agent System v6.2.0 protocol includes session memory as mandatory evidence
   - **Evidence**: v6.2.0 compliance claim (100%) was premature without session memory

### Corrective Actions Implemented

1. **Immediate**: Creating session memory now (this file) with RCA
2. **Pattern Update**: Recording "agent file recompilation REQUIRES session memory" in lessons learned
3. **Checklist Enhancement**: Will create issue to add "Session memory creation" as Step 7 in pre-creation protocol
4. **Self-Learning Activation**: Documenting this failure in `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/lessons-learned.md`

## Outcome
✅ **COMPLETE** — 100% Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance + session memory + RCA

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- **Minimal enhancement approach** (surgical changes, 49.4% character buffer)
- **Machine-readable 30K enforcement** (YAML block + BLOCKING + FAIL_VALIDATION)
- **Consumer mode clarity** (explicit differences from canonical mode)
- **6-step pre-creation protocol** (prevents common failures)
- **CS2 authorization model** (clear authority boundaries)

### What Was Challenging
- **Session memory creation**: Failed initially, required CS2 corrective action
- **Pattern recognition**: Did not apply lesson from PR #76 failure
- **Checklist completeness**: Pre-creation protocol missing "Create session memory" step

### What Failed
**I FAILED to create session memory for this PR initially.** 
- **Consequence**: PR marked incomplete despite claiming 100% compliance
- **Impact**: CS2 cannot merge without session memory (governance hygiene requirement)
- **Lesson**: "Agent file recompilation" = "Session memory MANDATORY"

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- **SESSION MEMORY IS MANDATORY for all agent file creation/modification PRs**
- **Minimal enhancement approach**: R_Roster pattern (15,191 chars, 49.4% buffer) is reusable for other consumer repos
- **30K enforcement pattern**: YAML `file_size_limit` block + CRITICAL constraint = gold standard
- **Consumer mode clarity**: Explicit section documenting differences prevents governance path confusion
- **6-step pre-creation protocol needs Step 7**: "Create session memory documenting the work"
- **Self-learning loop**: When CS2 issues corrective action, perform RCA and update lessons learned

### Governance Insights
- **Session memory is non-negotiable** for Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance
- **"100% compliance" claims require evidence trail** (session memory, RCA, lessons learned)
- **Pattern failures (PR #76, PR #114) indicate checklist gap** - need explicit "Create session memory" requirement
- **Self-learning loop requires activation trigger** - CS2 corrective action is that trigger
- **Minimal enhancement approach is reusable** - R_Roster demonstrates surgical changes work well
