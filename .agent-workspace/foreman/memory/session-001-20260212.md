# Session 1 - 20260212 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: foreman
- Class: supervisor
- Session ID: 20260212T124050Z

## Task
Implement unified merge gate interface to Living Agent System v6.2.0 standard for R_Roster repository per issue requirements and MERGE_GATE_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md.

## What I Did

### Files Created
- `.github/workflows/merge-gate-interface.yml` (650 lines, 3 standard jobs)
- `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh` (wake-up protocol for Living Agent System)
- `.github/scripts/session-closure.sh` (session closure and memory rotation)
- `.github/scripts/create-evidence-bundle.sh` (evidence artifact automation)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman/README.md` (workspace documentation)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman/personal/lessons-learned.md` (cumulative learning)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman/personal/patterns.md` (pattern recognition)
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive 10+ page migration guide)
- `PREHANDOVER_PROOF_2026-02-12T12-38-00Z.md` (evidence attestation)
- `.agent-admin/gates/gate-results-20260212T123732Z.json` (gate results)
- `.agent-admin/improvements/improvements-20260212T123732Z.md` (improvements capture)
- `.agent-admin/governance/sync_state.json` (governance alignment state)

### Actions Taken
1. Executed wake-up protocol to load identity, memories, and governance state
2. Reviewed canonical governance (MERGE_GATE_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md, FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md, EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md)
3. Analyzed existing workflows (deprecation-gate.yml, pre-implementation-review-gate.yml, yaml-validation.yml)
4. Designed unified merge gate interface with deterministic PR classification
5. Implemented three standard jobs: merge-gate/verdict, governance/alignment, stop-and-fix/enforcement
6. Created Foreman infrastructure (wake-up, session closure, memory management)
7. Built evidence artifact bundle system with automation
8. Documented migration path, troubleshooting, and deprecation timeline
9. Validated all YAML syntax, JSON schemas, and shell scripts
10. Executed code review (no issues) and security scan (no vulnerabilities)
11. Created PREHANDOVER_PROOF with complete attestation
12. Updated gate results and improvements capture
13. Executed session closure protocol

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Deterministic PR Classification**
- **What**: Implemented rule-based PR classification (not inference-based)
- **Why**: Eliminates misapplication errors; follows canonical pattern from MERGE_GATE_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md
- **Impact**: Predictable gate behavior, clear classification logic

**Decision 2: Evidence-First Validation**
- **What**: Check for evidence artifacts before running validation scripts
- **Why**: Aligns with MERGE_GATE_PHILOSOPHY.md confirmatory pattern; avoids redundant work
- **Impact**: Faster gate execution, clear error messages

**Decision 3: Legacy Gates Coexistence**
- **What**: Keep existing gates functional but make optional
- **Why**: Grace period allows smooth migration; reduces risk of blocking valid work
- **Impact**: Three-phase deprecation timeline (now through 2026-04-12)

**Decision 4: Foreman Memory Management**
- **What**: 5-session rotation with archive, personal learning never rotates
- **Why**: Per FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md requirements
- **Impact**: Persistent learning while managing workspace size

**Decision 5: Machine-Readable Gate Results**
- **What**: JSON schema for gate results with required fields
- **Why**: Per EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md; enables programmatic validation
- **Impact**: Eliminates narrative-only claims, enables fail-fast validation

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.agent-admin/gates/gate-results-20260212T123732Z.json`
- Status: Complete and valid
- All required artifacts present:
  - PREHANDOVER_PROOF_2026-02-12T12-38-00Z.md
  - Gate results JSON (validated)
  - Improvements capture (CAPTURED status)
  - Governance sync state (ALIGNED)

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required
- Ripple required: NO
- Rationale: Consumer repository implementing canonical standard; no changes to governance canon itself; implementations don't ripple per governance model

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected
- All canonical requirements clear and applicable
- TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST valid (no placeholder hashes)
- No ambiguities requiring escalation

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- All canonical references verified
- Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance confirmed
- Evidence artifacts complete and schema-valid
- No protected file modifications beyond authority

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Implementation successful. All deliverables completed:
- Unified merge gate interface implemented per v6.2.0 standard
- Foreman infrastructure established
- Evidence artifacts bundle created
- Comprehensive documentation provided
- Code review passed (no issues)
- Security scan passed (no vulnerabilities)
- Ready for merge pending branch protection update

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Wake-up protocol provided clear context** - Loading governance state, memories, and identity at session start established strong foundation
2. **Evidence-first design simplified gate logic** - Checking for artifacts before script execution eliminated complexity
3. **Deterministic classification avoided edge cases** - Rule-based PR classification eliminated ambiguity
4. **Comprehensive documentation upfront** - Creating MIGRATION_GUIDE.md early clarified requirements and edge cases
5. **Modular script design** - Separating wake-up, closure, and evidence bundle scripts enables reuse

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balancing gate comprehensiveness vs. simplicity** - Needed to cover all cases while keeping workflow readable
2. **Evidence schema design** - Required iteration to find right balance of structure vs. flexibility
3. **Migration planning** - Three-phase deprecation required careful timing and communication planning
4. **First session memory creation** - Establishing baseline for future sessions required thought about what to track

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Branch protection must be updated manually** - GitHub branch protection requires manual configuration for required contexts
2. **First real-world test in this PR** - Workflow will execute for first time; expect possible adjustments needed
3. **Legacy gates remain during grace period** - Don't remove old workflows until after 2026-04-12
4. **Evidence bundle automation simplifies PR creation** - Use `.github/scripts/create-evidence-bundle.sh` for new PRs
5. **Session memory rotation is automatic** - Session closure handles memory management; just fill in template

### Governance Insights
1. **MERGE_GATE_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md provides clear contract** - Standard job names eliminate ambiguity
2. **EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md enables automation** - Fixed paths allow scripting
3. **FM authority boundaries well-defined** - FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md clearly states autonomous fix authority
4. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 is comprehensive** - Framework covers all operational aspects (wake-up, execution, closure, memory)
5. **Consumer repository pattern works well** - Implementing canonical standards without modifying canon maintains clean separation
