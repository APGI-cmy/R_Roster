# PREHANDOVER PROOF

**Repository**: APGI-cmy/R_Roster  
**Branch**: copilot/update-prehandover-proof-template  
**Commit**: 4eb6ea0  
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-13T12:45:57Z  
**Agent**: governance-liaison  
**Task**: Layer down enhanced PREHANDOVER_PROOF template with embedded governance artifacts and CST validation sections

---

## Governance Artifacts (MANDATORY)

This section provides embedded or referenced governance artifacts required for full constitutional compliance and 10/10 governance auditability.

### Artifact 1: Governance Scan

**Purpose**: Pre-work governance compliance scan to identify applicable policies, bindings, and constitutional requirements.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Scan Method**: Manual review

**Artifacts**:
- **Embedded**: Yes
- **Separate File**: No

**Scan Results**:
```
GOVERNANCE SCAN OUTPUT

Canonical Governance Review (from maturion-foreman-governance):
- EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md v2.0.0+ - Enhanced with governance artifact requirements
- COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md v1.0.0 - CST validation requirements
- AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md - Tier-0 constitutional authority
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md - Supreme authority, Architecture → QA → Build → Validation

Constitutional Requirements Identified:
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF template v2.0.0 enhancement requirement (per issue)
- Four governance artifact sections mandatory
- CST validation attestation required
- Full 10/10 governance compliance support

Local Governance Review (this repository):
- governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md - Current version 1.0.0, needs enhancement
- .agent-admin/ structure - Needs artifact subdirectories
- All agent contracts reference PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE

Constitutional Principles Assessed:
- Build Philosophy compliance: N/A (documentation-only change)
- Zero Test Debt compliance: ✅ COMPLIANT (no code changes)
- Agent boundaries: ✅ COMPLIANT (governance liaison authorized for template layer-down)
- Execution Bootstrap Protocol: ✅ APPLICABLE (PREHANDOVER_PROOF generation required)

Governance Gaps Identified: NONE
```

### Artifact 2: Risk Assessment

**Purpose**: Comprehensive impact analysis and risk mitigation strategy for proposed changes.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Artifacts**:
- **Embedded**: Yes
- **Separate File**: No

**Risk Assessment**:
```
RISK ASSESSMENT OUTPUT

Repository Context: APGI-cmy/R_Roster (Teacher absenteeism management application)
Agent Context: All agents use PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE when submitting PRs

Impact Analysis:
- Template Enhancement: HIGH IMPACT
  - All future PRs will use enhanced template with governance artifacts
  - Increased diligence and auditability for all agent work
  - Template expands from 279 lines to 690 lines (247% increase)
  
- .agent-admin Structure: MEDIUM IMPACT
  - New artifact directories provide structured workspace
  - Example templates guide proper artifact creation
  - No impact on existing .agent-admin/validation/ files

- Documentation Quality: HIGH IMPACT (POSITIVE)
  - Comprehensive FAQ section added
  - Embedded vs separate file guidance clear
  - CST validation paths well-documented

Ripple Effects:
- governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md: Direct modification
- .agent-admin/: Directory structure expansion
- All agent contracts: Indirect impact (reference template, but no modification needed)
- Future PRs: Will benefit from enhanced template

Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Template complexity may overwhelm agents
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive FAQ, example templates, clear guidance
  
- Risk: Agents may skip governance artifacts
  - Mitigation: Template clearly marks artifacts as MANDATORY, completion checklist includes them
  
- Risk: Embedded vs separate file confusion
  - Mitigation: Clear decision guidance (< 100 lines = embed), examples for both patterns

Residual Risks: NONE (all risks mitigated)

Constitutional Compliance Risks: NONE
```

### Artifact 3: Change Record

**Purpose**: Detailed change log with rationale, decisions made, and traceability to requirements.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Artifacts**:
- **Embedded**: Yes
- **Separate File**: No

**Change Record**:
```
CHANGE RECORD OUTPUT

Change Summary:
Enhanced PREHANDOVER_PROOF template to v2.0.0 with four mandatory governance artifact sections (Governance Scan, Risk Assessment, Change Record, Completion Summary) and CST validation attestation section with three paths (Required/Not Required/Uncertain).

Files Modified:
1. governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md - Enhanced template
   - Added four governance artifact sections (embedded/separate file options)
   - Added CST validation section with Path A/B/C
   - Enhanced deliverables checklist
   - Expanded FAQ section significantly
   - Updated authority references to v2.0.0+
   - Version bumped from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

Files Created:
1. .agent-admin/README.md - Artifact directory documentation
2. .agent-admin/scans/EXAMPLE_governance_scan.md - Example governance scan template
3. .agent-admin/risk-assessments/EXAMPLE_risk_assessment.md - Example risk assessment template
4. .agent-admin/changes/EXAMPLE_change_record.md - Example change record template
5. .agent-admin/completion/EXAMPLE_completion_summary.md - Example completion summary template

Files Deleted: NONE

Design Decisions:

Decision 1: Embedded vs Separate File for Artifacts
Context: Governance artifacts can be lengthy, need flexibility
Options Considered:
  A. Always embed - Simple but bloats PREHANDOVER_PROOF
  B. Always separate - Clean but adds navigation overhead
  C. Agent choice with guidance - Flexible but needs clear rules
Decision Made: Option C with "< 100 lines = embed" guidance
Rationale: Balances simplicity for small artifacts with cleanliness for extensive ones
Trade-offs Accepted: Slight complexity in decision-making, but documented clearly

Decision 2: CST Validation Three Paths
Context: CST applicability varies by change type
Options Considered:
  A. Two paths (Required/Not Required) - Simple but no escalation path
  B. Three paths (Required/Not Required/Uncertain) - Clear escalation
Decision Made: Option B (three paths)
Rationale: Prevents agents from incorrectly self-exempting, provides clear escalation
Trade-offs Accepted: Template slightly longer, but safety enhanced

Decision 3: Example Templates Location
Context: Need to guide agents on artifact creation
Options Considered:
  A. In template as comments - Inline but clutters template
  B. Separate examples in .agent-admin/ - Clean but requires navigation
Decision Made: Option B with clear directory README
Rationale: Keeps template clean while providing comprehensive examples
Trade-offs Accepted: Agents must navigate to examples, but structure is clearer

Traceability to Requirements:
- Issue requirement "Four explicit artifact sections" → Implemented all four sections
- Issue requirement "CST validation attestation" → Implemented with three paths
- Issue requirement "Template supports 10/10 compliance" → Enhanced checklist and FAQ ensure completeness
- Issue requirement "Supporting example artifacts" → Created four example templates
- Issue requirement "Authority references" → Updated to v2.0.0+ with three authorities cited
```

## CST Validation Attestation

**CST**: Combined Systems Testing - Integration testing across multiple system components, services, or boundaries.

**CST Applicability**: ⚠️ NOT REQUIRED

### Path B: CST Not Required

**Reason for CST Exemption**:
- [x] Documentation-only changes (no code modified)
- [x] Governance-only changes (no application code affected)
- [ ] Single-component changes with no integration impact
- [ ] Unit tests sufficient (no cross-component interaction)
- [ ] Infrastructure/tooling changes (no application logic)
- [ ] Other: N/A

**Exemption Justification**:
```
Why CST is not applicable to this change:

1. This task involves only documentation and template enhancements:
   - Updated governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md (template file)
   - Created example artifact templates in .agent-admin/ (documentation files)
   - Created .agent-admin/README.md (documentation file)

2. No application code, test infrastructure, or executable logic was modified

3. No integration points between system components are affected

4. Changes are purely governance/documentation artifacts used by agents

What testing WAS performed instead:
- Governance gate validation (EXIT 0 - all checks passed)
- Template structure validation (verified 690 lines, artifact sections present)
- Example template review (all four examples created and structured correctly)
- Authority reference validation (v2.0.0+ references present)
```

**Attestation Authority**: governance-liaison  
**Reviewed By**: N/A (documentation-only change, no escalation required)  
**Exemption Status**: ✅ APPROVED (self-approved per documentation-only exemption)
