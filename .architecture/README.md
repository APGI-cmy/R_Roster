# Architecture Directory

This directory contains frozen architecture specifications for the R_Roster application.

## Purpose

According to the **Maturion Build Philosophy** and **FPC (Foreman Process Canon)**:

- Architecture must be **frozen** before any build wave begins
- All builders implement from frozen architecture specifications
- Architecture changes trigger wave restarts

## Structure

Architecture artifacts for this repository should be organized here following the FPC layerdown guide.
